    "From my tests, VADER seems to work better with things like slang, emojis, etc — whereas TextBlob performs strongly with more formal language usage. VADER not only tells the lexicon is positive, negative, or neutral, it also tells how positive, negative, or neutral a sentence is. VADER gave the correct output with some of the problematic sentences and executed. The output brought me to the conclusion that TextBlob was struggling with negative sentences, particularly negations. VADER outperforms TextBlob when it comes to negative polarity detection. We can conclude that VADER does better sentiment analysis when it comes to negative polarity detection. "
