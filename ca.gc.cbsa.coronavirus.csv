brad sledz,"piss of Trudope. this BS is unnecessary, costly, and damaging to the Canadian economy. you should be ashamed",1
Lynda,"It's lengthy, and you can't do itsooner than 3 days before you travel. You'll need your passport, vaccination/immunization record or test results if not immunized, and no how to take a photo of them in your phone, but once you've got all that in hand, the app works great and should save time at the border. I am a US citizen and I'll be entering Canada for a brief vacation in August 2022.",5
John P,Ridiculous and unnecessary collection of information. Same info is collected at the airport!,1
Tim Sullivan,"This is Canada's way of stemming the flow American poison: Crazy Dems kicking out the police, lifetime rule in all cities, abusing blacks, wacky climate control, you name it.

Jean-Francois Doucet Heon,"When crossing the border, nothing was told to us that we had to isolate but the next day, I started receiving false emails to isolate myself and family even if we met all the conditions to be exempted.

Kimberley Wolfe,"This form is an invasion of privacy and a violation of the freedom of mobility under our Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Canada is setting itself apart from the rest of the world in mandating the collection and use of this data, particularly where there is no longer a state of emergency and no grounds to continue relying on the override provisions of our constitution.

Graham Stratton,"Horrible UI, dispicaple Orwellian premise based on outdated tracing practices no longer active in Canada. I'm fully vaccinated and hate the execution of this app, it is an insult to air security and does nothing more than provide lip service to appease those who think this app is useful. Please reconsider requiring this for entry into our home country it is insulting and provides no value when no tracing is being performed.

Keith J. Wilson,"Pretty Easy and simple, enjoy Canada for ALL IT OFFERS!!!",4
Randy Crowley,Effortless. Works very well for me.,5
Guy Stone,This app makes no sense. If CBSA already knows I am vaccinated from my last trip... Why keep proving it? Trudeau is a bitter little man boy wanna be communist. CBSA staff are great - it's their communist leader Trudeau bought and paid for by the WEF that is making Canada one of the worst places to travel in the world.,1

Mark Coatsworth,"This app sucks and serves no purpose, Welcome to Canada",1
J T,"Great app. You too can get your digital ankle bracelet so that globalist elites can track you everywhere you go! It brings me a great sense of security and reminds me a lot of my safe space that I created at home. Sometimes I just open the app to get that comforting memory of the cushioned walls, gender-inclusive color scheme and library of furry mangas. Overall I'd give this app a standing ovation except I'm worried that if I stand I may offend the legless community. #IStandWithUkraine",1
Marion Jung,easy to use,5
Toni Deschaine,Easy to complete,5
stephen adam,"Unnecessary. Provincial vaccination proof is all you need. This is just redundancy and shows the need to centralize healthcare, or leave it wholly to the provinces to manage. Classic bureaucracy.",1

James Kunkel,this app sucks worst UI ever,1
Cynthia Wauer,"I read some bad reviews about this app, but personally found it pretty straight forward and easy to complete. Though it did take a while to complete. Just read everything thoroughly and have your documents ready, I took photos of my proof of vaccination beforehand and just attached the photo.",4
Mike B,Thought we live in a democracy. Guess not,1
RONALD CAO,"I was fully vaccinated.  After a short trip to the States the app commanded me to do a 14-day quarantine. Or I may be subject to tickets, fine or imprisonment. Scary! I called support. After waiting 45 minutes a lady said it was a mistake but she cannot correct it.  She gave me a long URL on the phone that I can report. But the URL always returned 404 after confirming a few times.  I asked to email me the URL.  She said she didn’t use email. Wish no one will have the nightmare",1

Melania Karpinska,"Just tried to create an account. Latest app version downloaded. Got passed the verification code and typed it in, but before advancing to next screen I was kicked out back to submmiting e-mail again, when I did, it showed a message ""the account already exists"" and wouldn't allow me to continue. Since it wasn't verified, I can't log in either. This app is poorly designed and flawed with programing issues. Thid app is imposed mandatory on travlers yet it's unreliable or outright not functioning.",1
Guy Beauvais,Smooth and Simple,5
Kris,"The app does not work. You can't create an account. As per CBS review responses I typed out the email etc and had the same experience when veryfing account creation, ""Please check that the email address and password you entered were correct and that your device is connected to the internet"".

Buck C,unnecessary,1
Mark Joseph Yap,"So check in to airplane requires me to finish the app. I can't provide the app with information about my flight unless I check in. I'm stuck in a horrible infinite regression.

C.W. van der Ende,make sure all travellers live at same addresd,2

John Jurkuvenas,no problems,5
Momi Sekhon,I appreciate this process for safeguard of public health. it was easy to complete,5
T R,Irrelevant. Adds completely unnecessary step to travel. Most questions asked were Irrelevant to a border crossing. This should used be an optional way to handle your declaration.. not a mandatory way to bother you later at your house or by phone. Also.... we can all see there are about a million 1 star reviews. The average rating is a farce.,1

Hilling Ezack,"the passport photo feature is not fast or accurate, wasting more time than manual entry.

Alejandro Azcona,handy,5
Étienne Rancourt,We do not feel in 2022 when we use this app. Our vaccination information should be linked to our passport number.

Adam Wu,I think this is a pretty decent designed app for the purpose it serves.,5
Charles Bayer,"An evil app. Recently caused boy scouts to be stuck in Zurich because the app wasn't working - these kids are stuck overseas because of this ridiculous app. Glitches abound - the app can RANDOMLY ORDER people fully vaccinated without symptoms of COVID into quarantine.

Joe Cicchillo,easy to use,5
Jörg Löhken,"Basically, the app is nice, quick to use, with one gigantic head scratcher: if you want to add a new trip, you have to delete the old one, and by the way the UI of the app works, this is far from obvious. Took me one call to their help line (half an hour before the actual trip!) to find that out, and even the rep wasn't exactly sure. Once I did that and registered the new trip, all was quick, but also just because I had chosen to save my user. Why not just add a ""+"" button for a new trip?",4

Found out from staff at the border that the trick is to delete the app and reinstall it when I got to Canada (yes, I had the latest version). Even had some get upset with me for not completing the submission ahead of time even though I tried. Why is this a trick to get it to work? Why not just make a proper app where we don't need to worry about and rely on constantly deleting the app every time?",1

Derek Dee,wow gov overreach much,1
AKGypsy1960,"Good idea. mostly self explanatory. Does need better instructions for those of us traveling through to Alaska. Biggest frustration was the app would not proceed without a Canadian address where you'll be staying. We are traveling in an rv, so I finally decided to put the address of a place we could camp near Osoyoos IF QUARANTINE IS REQUIRED. Hopefully that is the info it needed.

Rich Limoges,"Buddy was selected for a ""random quarantine"" a week before our trip. Fully vaccinated persons are exempt from this, and even though this app contains his vaccination information, there was nothing we could do.

Marcelo Saldana,very helpful and very easy to use,5
Sandra Lemieux,"The stupidest thing they ever came up with first of all I'm a nurse and it doesn't even go far back enough for the dates because they didn't offer the vaccines in Canada I got mine in the USA completely senseless since nurses and other professionals can run around all they want everyday that they're there working this at the height of stupidity ! absolutely stupidity !

Gavin Clark,I shouldn't have to do this to come home,1
David Parker,This app is an embarrassment to Canada. I wanted to break my phone in half while filling out these forms. There is no valid public health purpose for this at this stage in the pandemic. We are killing our tourism industry for the sake of political theatre.,1

Scot Wavra,Awesome,5
Spikegary,painful to use.,2
Lee Autore,nice and easy to use interface,5
Jeffrey Frost,"It's the government, so my expectations are a LOT lower than with a private app where they are motivated by survival in the face of competition. Still, the experience is user friendly and efficient. For example, passport and vaccine papers only need to be uploaded once. It retains those documents for future entries and that saves a lot of time. That makes the whole process effortless after the first time. Much appreciated!",5

Ben Yado,wish it was even simpler by just providing the vaccination documents.,3
Jaydeepsinh Mahida,Great app one can easily navigate through.,5
Diako Dabiri,"Unfortunately I very much dislike the app. It's difficult to use, does not save progress if you quit by accident, and if you don't fill this out, you get hit with a $6000+ fine. A MUCH better alternative would have been to simply require a vaccination card.",1

Christopher Taylor,This app is all right and OK. I am visiting friends and family on short notice and it worked like magic. 10/10 would use again.,5
Debbie Buller,This app is very inconsistent. This morning my travellers info was saved from previous use. But the app was timing out while submitting the form. I waited till this afternoon and now my traveller's info is not there but my flight info i entered this morning is...I decided to log out and log back in and now it said my password was invalid! I reset it and it still won't accept it. So now what am I to do? Very annoying while this is a requirement we need to complete.,2

Jeremiah Williams,so good,5
Thomas Golec,unecessary garbage,1
Dagmara R Naruns,"It was difficult to work through to the end. The lack of additional prompts on each page leads one to conclude erroneously, that one is finished when you press save. In addition, there should be a more seamless flow to the next question. Too much back & forth to get to the end of a section. It would have been helpful to see a prompt that there were still 2-3 sections that needed to be completed, This form does not allow for a second cruise to be filled when you are travelling on the same ship",3
Christine Tse Kuecherer,Straightforward and no crashes.,5
Sharon Derr,easy,5

Craig Walker,"Useful, but perhaps not flexible enough (e.g. day trips not involving overnight stays).",2
Sudhir Raghu,"This high tech app's UX has been designed very smoothly with a clean onboarding flow. I'd have preferred an option to scan the vaccine certificate's QR code and clearer markers on Calendar for changing the year.

saleem sheriff,great app with easy and simple to navigate,5

Jonny,"Absolute garbage! App behaves like it was programmed by a 3rd grade reading level mongoloid with no English skills and appears to track location Nevermind being completely useless. I cross the border (unvaccinated) every day and I have never once been asked by the border guards about this app, even when I mention it none of them even know what I'm talking about. This app offers no info and it is absolutely pointless, just like everything else this government does, inept and useless. Zero Stars.",1

Linda O,It's been a couple hours. It seems to be frozen at 80 percent saved. What do I do next????,1
Farah Farah,I would give it zero if that option is available. I downloaded the app in Toronto before my trip. I filled it out a day before my departure and submitted but it kept failing. Then found out there's an update. Downloaded that. I had to re-enter info. Successfully entered flight information. When it came to COVID self assessment the Yes No buttons would not appear and beyond that I could not proceed. Called the embassy few times and that failed miserably. No one answers.,1
Katman,"Ridiculous that a mandatory app doesn't even work properly, constantly saying ""cannot connect to internet"" every time I try to finish my application.",1
Matthew Bundala,"It's great, fast, easy to use and understand. It could add a dark mode, but that's totally not requirement for a utility app like this.",5
Isaac Santos,"Doesn't work,been trying to fill out my health form for 2 hours now",1
camron kelly,"As a frequent traveller to Canada I hate this god damned app. What's the point? It's not like I get to leave my travel documents at home. Even with a Nexus you have to refill the same information every day, tiring! Just another hoop to jump through with no benefit to anyone except for the overpaid engineers making it. Remember everyone, every time a new restriction is added to crossing the border we'll get to fill out another page of the app!",1
Jackson Treanor,What a joke. Really sucks to be canadian,1
Michael Verde,"What a horribly buggy app! I added 5 members to my party and yet in the next step it only includes 3. It tells me I don't have an internet connection when I can confirm that I absolutely do through any other app or browser. When I go to submit my public health declaration it fails to submit, again supposedly because I don't have an internet connection. Do better with my taxpayer money!",1

varun pandu,easy to use and user friendly,5
Keith Brocklesby,The app is easy to complete but I had a problem inputting my flight arrival time in the app. I am due to arrive at 1435. The only option in the app was to select 2.35 but it would not let me click on pm only am and that is what it recorded. I just hope there is no problem when I arrive 12 hours after my stated arrival time in Canada hence the 3 star rating. I went back into the app to amend it but again it just recorded am! Why does it not use the 24 hour system it would be much easier.,3
Ian Bengivingo,pain to use at airport,1
robin singh,it won't let you change the time of the arrival it's keep defaulting to the time,3

Jodi Ostrowski,Easy!,5
Joanne Brey,A+,5
Cody Hunter,Constant annoying notifications,1
Devin Dzelme,"App does not tell you you must have a test to gain entry back home. It makes a sub point that certain test types that are negative are accepted a day before departure yet it says you could be at risk of denied entry. Can the government and app just be to the point and remove the ambiguity. I'm on a work and business trip and just want to come home knowing I need to get A, be and c done. The app is more efficient for travellers that fly often than before. just wish it was more concrete",2

Eamonn Flynn,complicated,1
Synes Notter,Is this a joke? On the government webpage it states that you have to use the latest version released on 28.june (today) onwards. Well that version is not available yet so if you are traveling today you are just out of luck. Looks like the IT department forgot to release the new app version.,1

Michael Young,outdated information,1
jeff babienko,"a little clunky, but functional",4
Richard Saini,"Terrible, would not recommend this app",1
Andrew Paton,I've used this app a few times now and I'm still unimpressed. Problem 1 is if you're going to put a heavy requirement on a peice of software it should be bullet proof. Instead we get rotors like you're not on the latest version. I expect the engineers to handle this when an app is apparently so important. The best though is the 7 times I had to capture a photo of vaccine records. You know after doing the same operation 7 times it just magically works. This is not the quality I expect.,1
Andrew Cholfe,"It won't even let me create an account. If this thing is mandatory, make it work.",1

Allan Arsenault,No issues and easy to complete and sped entry back into Canada.,4
Ciprian Zaharia,If you want people to use the app then it should work on any phone. Even on the worst Chinese clone. I have a top of the line 2017 Samsung phone but I can't use the app because I supposedly modified the phone. Which I did not. But it should not matter if I modified the phone. I am not streaming copyrighted information I am just trying to fill a freaking form. I know I can use the website but why if I have a phone that is good for everything else but ArriveCan? I can even fill a bad review with,1

Toby Lynn,I never could get the time of arrival to be correct between AM and PM. I hope this does not cause any arrival issues,3
Stefan Mungal,Smooth and easy process,5
Diosa Adams,I just wish covid info was listed sooner in the process so I could be sure to have cards ready and know the process. I stopped until I got passports entered (was waiting until they arrived in mail) but knowing covid needs ahead would have been helpful. So the option to skip around to get all of the info ahead of time would have been helpful.,4
Terry Walker,easily completed,5
Nadeem Saeed,great app,5
Charles Eric Bourgeois,"actually the worst app I ever use very un useful and time consuming like everything the government do , they do it very badly , I don't recommend but since you're forced to use it , i bett I'll use it kindly a piss Canadian",1

Alexander Summers,"Good app and mostly smooth, but when entering arrival times the clock repeatedly adjusts your time without explaining why (it's trying for one in the 72 hour window) - very frustrating unless you realise what's really happening",4

G H,Simple but time consuming when entering the family.,5
Toby Riley,Very difficult to use!,1
Gregory Mantell,"1) Delta never told us that we had to use this app prior to our flight to Canada. We learned about this requirement while checking in and it took a long time. 2) The app would not take a picture of our passports even after closely following all instructions. After trying for several minutes, we had to enter all info manually including hotel address. I wish Canada would think these things through and test the app prior to make it a requirement.",1
Li-Ming Law,Telling me inaccurate I formation that I need to quarantine and do a day 8 test when I was told at the border I do not have to do so and I am exempt from the 14 day quarantine and day 8 test. Limited options to contact help to have this information corrected.,1

James Burtch,"All apps have room for improvement, however this one was so easy to use it's hard to find where it could be more efficient. Well done.",5
JimBo,"I feel this app is only used to verify your Covid vaccines. It doesn't help you at the border IMO. Unless the border agents designate ArriveCan users vs non users at the crossing, will it not speed anything up. I could probably use my vaccine cards and passport cards and skip the app.",1
Mike Klooaterman,"it's fast, straightforward and efficient.",5
Bradley Lloyd,"Honestly, I'd prefer this method for a customs declaration as opposed to returning to the previous paper method.",5
Michael O'Beirn,"Easy to use, keeps information from earlier trips.",4

Mklady D,As of 6/26/22 the ArriveCAN website says the latest version of this app was released on 5/12/2022 AND the version should read v.2.29. This version says v2.29.9. Which is correct or most recent?,1
John Loreto,waste of time and public funds!,1

Tried to get on and it then said already signed up which I never did. Then I tried to say forgot password and they were to email a new one and I tried this multiple times and never received 1 email! I'm going in 5 days to Canada but won't be able to enter because of this app!!!! Help,1

It is seems to me others had a same issue and it should be from app and I think health Canada should look at it.,4
Kari-Astrid Haugeto,incredibly simple and easy to use,5

Diane Murray,"Utterly useless. Won't accept password, even when it's reset. I've got a trip to Canada in September 22, and I'm supposed to use this so I can go and visit my cuz for a few days. I've got the NHS Covid vaccination app which has a QR code. Why can't that be used instead???? This is extremely frustrating and stressful!! Also, when I registered, it wanted pdf docs downloaded.

Later, I entered our travel information via the mobile app. It worked fine and there was 1 QR code generated for the whole family. No one at the airport (in Costa Rica) asked to see it, although we were still asked for physical or digital proof of vaccination before boarding for Canada. No one in Canada upon arrival asked for the ArriveCan code, so what is the point exactly?",4

Waqar Qureshi,useless app making it harder for travellers to come home,1
Igor Victor Kras,"App does not allow to just scan the federal proof of vaccination QR code to provide the required information. App forces users to go over 5+ screen, MANUALY enter all the data and then upload the image from downloads or the gallery ONLY.

Next thing you know, arrivecan has us in ""quarantine""..we are NOT.

Edythe Frankel Kelleher,"freezes up, can't get to things. have heard it works better onboard, we'll see",1
Whirl Traveller,This is a terrible app for reasons that I will outline below but the sad part is that there does not seem to be a way to have it addressed. I had difficulty using it from Mexico last year. I recently tried it again from Paris. It kept saying that my wife needed to produce a negative test result although vaccinated Canadians ate NOT required to obtain a pcr test. We are both vaccinated four times.

What's worse, when electing b to use the app's info the app would switch me to Canadian addresses and provinces ( I live in US). I repeatedly restarted, but never could make it through this step.

Julie Fillion,"It would be reassuring on the mobile app to actually be able to SEE the documents one has carefully uploaded from their home computer before the trip... Not being able to double check that indeed the vaccination proof is there is quite worrysome. In addition, apparently (according to website info) there is an update, but no way to get the update either from the app itself or from Google Play.

We can't get past that point to submit the form no matter what we try. We were at the border. The agent there was shockingly rude. He told me he had helped a thousand people that day and I was the only one who had a problem with the app. He told me to go outside and keep trying and not to come back if it did not work.",1

Matt Rees,"Overall frustrating af. And always have to update and never remember the password for an app i rarely use. It doesn't even have all the crossing stations listed, nor by Province to narrow it down. Does the GOC not know where all it's border posts are, come on, lazy, lazy, lazy. Scrap this app and go back to reliable hard copy. It's endemic now anyway, so what is the point of this app really?",1

Chris Thompson,"Congrats on moving even further into being a fascist country. App needs access to all info on the phone if you read the agreement, and then requires you to book each time you pass. Even if you manage to upload it without it failing at 12 percent and freezing, you still need to present your passport and covid card if asked, and risk being quarantined. Ridiculous and over stepping.",1
Karleigh Bandor,"I hate this app. First off that it exists and I'm required to use it as a Canadian citizen who is returning home from travel, but also how it requires updates frequently yet never seems to update anything of importance. For example, having to put in an address for a 14 day quarantine even though that isn't required when returning to Canada after being vaccinated. I also think it's a bit ridiculous to expect someone coming into the country by a land border to know the exact time they'll cross.",1
Betty Jo Penner,Will not complete application!,3
Jason Eisner,"it's very strange that I was asked to provide the address where I'm staying in Canada, when I'm only flying through. I had to look up the postal code for the airport and everything! Was the check-in agent wrong to tell me that I had to use the arrive CAN app?",2

Stamata Calender,It always freezes on me,1
Vlad Shvartsman,How safe is my data? Android security is full of holes. How do I know my passport data will not be intercepted by hackers and used for terrorism purposes?

Christina Ciraco,"It's ok, but missing some important things. Why should I need to enter all of the vaccination info like which one I got and the dates when you could scan the QR code instead? Also there's no consideration of whether you got the booster (and the QR would take care of that too). The camera crashed right after the scan of my passport but then it kept working so that was fine. Also links to other countries' requirements would be super helpful, like US and Europe.",3

Rob Karnis,Program will not accept password reset code.,1
Joe Martino,"Governments should not be tracking their citizens in this manner, especially given the nature of COVID. The use of this app is a sign of a bad direction for this country.

Mahesh Sankaran,"The app is easy to use and convenient. I like the fact that if you have a pass for an upcoming visit, it shows up as soon as you log in. Two comments: The app has not been updated for the fact that Canada no longer requires a pre-approval test. So it still threatens you with dire consequences if you don't have proof of a negative test. Secondly, I have been unable to update the app to the latest version. When I try to update it at the Google Play store, it just hangs.",5

Z. R.,"Worked fine on Samsung tablet and Google phone. Installed on the tablet, entered 2 passengers, completed info for a return trip and received my epass. Installed on phone and epass was there too. One confusing issue: In order to upload your vaccine passport you have to find your file, then ""proceed without proof of vaccine"". Only then will it upload. Confusing and counter intuitive. Other than that works fine.",5

I've returned from a 2 days quick trip, and I keep receiving notifications to log my quarantine health status information. I don't want to simply block the app notifications cause in the future I will need to use it again and I would like to be notified. So, there should be an option on the Quarantine status form asking if I'm still in Canada. If I'm no longer there, there's no reason to log anymore. Thanks",4

When tried to contact support by email they just kept sending me the same canned messages and would not help me at all. I had to phone to get help with a simple question. FYI - the issue is the product is listed as COMIRNATY which is Phizer's new name but is not listed in the app as such.,2
Joken ta Marija,Keep akin for a valid email address. After both emails match. Sometimes these apps are in overload. Lucky I don't need this app right now.,1

Jerry Fritzedley,Not user friendly,2
James Sharp,"Frustrated is not the word.If you have to have this app to gain entry into Canada I suspect there won't be many tourists visiting. When I tried to sett up an account it would not allow me saying ""make sure I have an Internet connection""etc which I have then tried resetting another password and getting codes to enter Still would not let me go forward. Why are we having these problems? Please sort this app out",1
Rupa Mazumder,"Idea is good but the App is temperamental. If you get an error message try again, it may work itself out.",3

Pramjeet Kaur,This application is very good,5
Diana Young-Clarke,It's easy to use however it's not updated to say that we don't need to show a negative COVID test result for our return on April 1. That could be a little confusing for some people.,4
Guida Williamson,"I am traveling April 1st. According to Canada government website, I no longer require a covid test so why is the app asking for one???",3
James Heilman,This app serious is poor. It does not correctly determine who does and dose not need to isolate.,1
Cynthia Iaboni,Its stupid. You still have to show all other forms of documentation. This does not eliminate any other documents. Just adds to it. Government has nothing better to do but create more paperwork and cut down more trees.,1

Bruce Koren,"I've tried several times to install the app on my Android phone, without success! I have plenty of available memory/storage space, but no luck!

When I try to upload proof of vaccination it gets stuck at 12% for a minute then says it failed to upload. This happens for both camera or pdf uploads",1
Ricky Bobby,Just created my account and uploaded pdf of vaccination. There is no way within the app to verify what you've uploaded...you cannot click on the document (pdf) and open it from within the app. I guess I'll have to trust it's correct when I arrive at the border? Very disconcerting.,3
Alex Simic,"I have tried multiple times to upload data and proof of vaccination. Back if February, the customs agent said everything came through fine. Now it doesn't. I don't really have time for this app to fail every time I cross. It will not accept my proof of vaccination certificate",1

Andy Wilson,"I am impressed by the rapid and continuing evolution of this app. The pandemic has presented an ever changing challenge and this app has met the challenges not only by evolving with changes, but by actually improving user friendliness as it goes. Nice work!",5
Adam,If you want to see how bad this app is. Look at the number of people that have to come out of line at the airport to try and download the app. and attempt to make it work. It is constantly stuck with the spinning wheel and continuous issues where it won't let you move to the next screen. If you are at the airport watching this you will see how our Federal government has totally failed us. As people have been missing flights as they could not make this work in time before cut off times.,1
Rob Savage,Sorry but will not let me create account. Finally got it working only to find a day later after adding all my info it wouldn't open. Very frustrating.,1

Jola Sliwinski,It doesn't work at all. I would like to get a help with the installation . Check troubleshooting there is no mention in about my problem. Is there any phone # can I talk to someone? My problem is with verification of my email. I created an account but it would open because I didn't verify my email. I got the code on my email but there nothing else where do I go to verify it ? So I went back to create new account . It says this account already exist. I tried few times no way out.,1
Stephanie Norrie,"This is so pointless. Travel docs get uploaded. But then you don't have to upload your negative covid test results (ISN'T THIS THE POINT OF THE APP?!) after the misery of organizing, paying for and completing the tests within the proper timelines. We weren't asked for the qr code at the border and now I'm getting asked for our quarantine information daily despite supposedly not needing to quarantine after our return. Sidenote, we're all fully vaxxed. Seriously...how is this helping anyone?!",1
Kevin De Andrade,"Only lets me complete the form for one of three travellers, for two of us after the upload of vaccine info, it just returns to the list of travellers instead of progressing to the proof of negative test and quarantine info. I guess our kid will be able to return to Canada but not my wife and I since he's the only one with the code for completing the process.

Thomas Rohricht,"Used ArriveCan during a border-crossing road trip for 3 people. Entering traveller info is a pain because passport scanning is buggy, but once I entered things manually and had a QR code, I thought I was good to go. I was wrong. When we got to the border I started the app and logged in, but the line of cars ahead was slow and while we waited the app timed out. When our turn came I tried to log back in but the app crashed, and then it simply lost our trip profile with all traveller data. Gone.",1
Diane Raven,"What a freaking nightmare of endless loops. First you are told you cannot do an at-home test. Now apparently you CAN do an ""approved"" rapid test in front of a medical professional, even via telehealth. And why does the Canadian government need to know the exact MINUTE of my arrival? This app requires that. What if the ferry is late or there's a long line of cars at the border? This info is required to be submitted BEFORE you arrive. Poorly written and confusing. Boo, hiss.",1

Leo Guy,Absolute jock of a system to monitor if you have COVID or not. Only one question. If you have a cough or fever (just 2 common things). There are more symptoms then that. Not sure if after 2 years if the Canadian government has any idea how to control this thing or not. These morons that forced unvaccinated people to do mandatory quarantine after travel and allowed vaccinated people to run free don't think things through or at least don't want to.,1
Sheelagh Gunn,I've installed and Uninstaller this app and it keeps telling me log in failed/error and check to see if I'm connected to the internet. Beyond frustrating and we need this 😫,1

Mark Warren,Rooted users will be stranded at the border! The developer has disabled the app for rooted users however it doesn't tell you this until you've gone through the setup and you're already on your trip. Absolute trash and the developer should be fired. He must be a unionized government worker.,1
Mike MacKenzie,"What a waste of time,aldergrove border says they don't look at it. Just wanted my Nexus card, but this border seems very lazy,very rarely do they have the nexus open. They even have truckers place their own in bond seals on their loads,that defeats the purpose. 0",1

Curt Munro,garbage app,1
Bazza White,"I downloaded the app and used it in November and December to cross the land border as I live circa 6 kms. away. There was no issue. Then about 3 weeks ago it stopped working on my Pixel 3. Every time I tried to log in the ""sign in failed"" and default supported message appeared. On my wife's Pixel 5 no problem. I could also log into the website using always the same email address and password. I FINALLY FOUND OUT WHY and it's irritating because it was never an issue until recently. It also may be why you're having a problem. For some reason the app ""decided"" to no longer recognize the automatic clipboard fill in - you know as you type your email it usual default email appears below on the clipboard and you just click it. This still works on the Pixel 5 but on my Pixel 3 I have to type the complete email address and the complete password. It only took 3 weeks to figure this out. Thank god I didn't use the government service which would have taken hours, days or even weeks to resolve, if ever.",1

If governments and companies are going to discriminate against and deny access to people that do not have the latest tech with ""mandatory"" apps then they better start providing the latest technology, keeping it, the operating system and the apps up to date.

Sameer Zaman,App doesn't allow for under 12 to have vaccine uploaded. Doesn't give you the option to add vaccine information for fully vacced children under 12. Which of course sets you up to be randomly selected for extra testing. I could give this app a zero star I would but I can't so it gets a one.,1
Anita Barker,The app will not accept my email address. I can't set up an account.,1
Barb Ewens,I can't even open it! and your response saying to contact you is a joke. There is no way to contact you you don't respond. I've spent hours trying to fill out this form and the one time I got to the end and hit submit it went NOWHERE just kept saying 'we can't try again.,1

Which was a non reply designed to move me along. How is it I would not have a secure internet connection more than anyone travelling in the world using WIFI. If you have no answer why not man up and say ""I dont know"". And we will test. With this answer you are telling yourself there is no problem and that the problem lies with me.

Norman Grdina,"Greetings Everyone and Canada I am a CPA, Private investigator, Certified Fraud Examiner and owned my own practice for over 40 years. Please be advised that I have never encountered such a poorly developed program and App in my entire professional career. For Starters, I totally understand the reasoning for such a program but do not understand that an individual requires two devices to proceed to complete any ArriveCan instructions. Several of my elderly clients have indicated their frustration in crossing the border to visit love ones and simply could not complete or understand the application. I now understand why. Yes, These are difficult times but we need not make them any worse for computer illiterate Canadian citizens. Understand that my wife and I proceeded across the Douglas border crossing to check on our property in Blaine Washington to assess a flooding issue and returned to Canada in 1 hour but waited in the what seemed to me to be an interrogation centre inside the border offices for well over and hour. Other Canadians where undergoing a public interrogation amongst about 15 other people. This is not the way to treat any individual entering Canada. The Fact the Border facility did not have internet services enhance our inability to access our system to complete the ArriveCan App. May I suggest an alternate system were Canadian Citizens entering Canada can have the option of being interviewed, provided with a testing kit and instructed to visit LifeLabs, shoppers Drugs or any other approved venders to submit the ""Covid-19 Home Collection Kit"" After about an hour of waiting time a delightful young gentleman interviewed my wife and I as we could not access our phone system to register or download ""ArriveCan. We were on our way once he received an approval to document our information from his supervisor. We returned home only to encounter additional problems using the ArriveCan app. My wife after attempting to use ArriveCan got assistance from a representative and completed the download process in about an hours time. Do understand that we do not use out of date systems but due to the fact our systems work on terminal servers the App simply would not work until we logged off and attempted with much effort to use another stand alone system. We woke up this morning to log in to proceed with My wife's ""Home collection Kit"" and spend another 3/4 of an hour to communicate with our mentor who could not hear us through his system which we mitigated by calling him directly on our land phone. Unfortunately, the gentlemen indicated that this was his first call and thank us. As I finalize this e-mail, I have given up my attempts to log into ArriveCan and will not bore you with further details and I am going directly to shoppers to complete this process as I am totally frustrated with time we have expended for a one hour trip to Birch Bay to assess our flood damage. I am a very concerned citizen and would certainly be available to offer some assistance to the developers of this software and any alternate course of action which would ease the frustration of Canadians who need to travel to the US and Return in a reasonable time Frame. Please accept my experience in a positive manner and hopefully you can learn from my experience as a Nexus Card holder from serval years but unable to renew same due to Covid-19 Thank you",2

Jo-Ann Grawbarger,"You would think after all this time the app would be a little more user friendly. When returning to Canada from a short trip, it should ask you if you are required to quarentine. It automatically assumes you are. If you try and resubmit for another trip, you can't. You are stuck on a single screen asking you to report your symptoms. This happens for the next 14 days.

No one at the airport even ended up asking for the arrive can receipt. What a waste of time.",1

Change the date of birth for your kids under 12 to make them > 12 years old and then you can get to the vaccination info upload screen.

Anthony Wong,"Terrible! It says my email address was already used to set up an account which it wasn't. Then it refuses to send a password reset email. Same problem using the website. I reported this to CBSA in great detail and they sent a canned response like I was some kind of idiot that didn't know how to properly type my email address. Then they replied to this review to tell me to respond to the CBSA email which is sent from a ""no-reply"" email address. Now their website contact form produces an error.",1
Chris Robinson,"This is now the third time I uninstall and install the app only to get stuck on the password screen, passwords come up green and I cannot ""Create Account"", just keep pressing and it does nothing!!

Victor Finapri,Good Canadian Government Initiative.👍,5
Peter Featherstone,"Asinine. It took me less than five minutes this evening to fill up my vehicle with gas, out of doors, and thirty minutes inside Douglas border crossing to convince a border guard that the QR code was legitimate. The app seems designed to expose as many visitors as possible to potentially infected, asymptomatic border guards. This app can only do more harm than good. Paul Martin decided years ago that visitors returning to Canada would fill in only one white card per family which was still one too many. The present Government is paddling quickly backwards. The border guard helping me told me he did not know how the app worked but I had the choice of making it work or spending a fortnight in quarantine. This app is deplorable and should be removed from Google Play. Last week a border buard told me he could see my vaccine history on the screen in his booth; tonight another border guard told me the information was unavailable. This backend is much better at purging than storing. The app is useless. The border website clearly says that BC residents can ""take short trips to access necessities such as food, medication and fuel"" but the border guards remain as troglodytes.None of them fully understand the current restrictions; they should all be retrained or laid off.",1
Jeff Bosma,Did not work properly. Would not load docs properly.,1
Eric Mok,Another stupid government craps,1
Note 8,"Allow a few days to get registered. Whether on a PC, an android device or an Apple device the service had failed to send the required verification code. Looking at server logs there has been no attempt to connect to send the code. I could live with that and jump through whatever hoops are needed manually; however, there is no alternative. The report a problem link gives to a large not arrivecan specific loop that also has no contact information. I think you can go to service canada in perso",3
Jeffrey Resnick,Too many difficulties. Asks for 14 day quarantine plan. We are going for five days. I would rather just be denied entry. I am otherwise fully vaccinated with a negative test result,2
Sean Young,Government failure again. App will not allow me to sign in. I know my Email and password. Getting me to use data I pay tax on is criminal. Government supports the two monopolies that over charge Canadian citizens for data and cellphone services.,1
Omar Abouhassan,Joke app. If you're gonna make us jump through hoops...build an app that works. Upload stuck at 80%....,1
Leidamae Solijon,It doesn't load properly. You get to the submit page and it won't submit...,1
Dylan Smythe,Another failure on Oui Oui Beau Beau two faced Justine Trudeau's government. Everyday I keep getting wake up messages telling me to quarantine. I spoke to someone last week telling them that I don't need to quarantine. I have been vaccinated and that I had tested negative before coming back to Canada. They told me they would fix it. They did not. Still getting wake up messages telling me to quarantine.,1

David Rée,Very user unfriendly.,1
Victor Manuel Mendez Fonseca,Terrible! Proof of vaccination not recognized. I uploaded photos and federal and provincial proof of vaccination PDFs. None of them were accepted. No option to modify after the final QR is shown. I'm traveling with another passenger. Initially person A proof was not recognized and person B was. I eliminated the application and started over and the opposite happened. Impossible to get both persons vaccination proof recognized at the same time. App crashed once when uploading proof of vaccination,1
Marianne McKerlie,This is a terrible app. Neither me or my partner were able to get the app to work at the Miami Airport. We finally had to get a staff member from American Airlines to do it on her phone so that we could check in.,1
Raquel L,"App keeps freezing. Unable to upload vaccine documentation. Freezes at 80%. Tried 3x, and resets you back to passport input step. Furthermore, I've traveled already using the app, but my profile was erased without my knowledge (last traveled 2 months ago so it wasn't that long ago). Is there a reason why I have to start from scratch again? Please fix freezing issue and don't delete user profiles once setup!",1

Peter Horwood,Garbage! app constantly freezes up when you're trying to load up your proof of vaccination card! Must uninstall and reinstall this will be my 4th attempt at entering data.,1
Peter B,This app is horrible! It does not recognize responses and freezes you out of making corrections. Its DESIGNED to prohibit entry into Canada. If the Arctic Ocean suddenly bordered the northern US it would not upset me,1

Char Glas,Never encounter anything worst than this app. Wonder if designer of the ap is qualified. Would appreciate knowing which institute from which he or she graduated so i ensure my family members never attend it. Tell me that there is an error in email or password over 100 times. Strangely is the only app in all my life that has done that. After getting variation code cannot gett back the screen to input it. App is clumsy . No way such a mandatory requirement be incompetent,1
Sofia Sharma,I'm unable to create an account. Gave several attempts but I don't understand what seems to be the problem...the page freezes!!,1

Graeme McCallum,"POS App! Keeps crashing. It won't accept my screenshot of my Federal Covid-19 Proof of Vaccination that I JUST got.... App developer, hang your head in shame!",1
Peter P,Entered traveler info and covid verification twice and saved and still says you have no travelers registered. Wiped the app storage then repeated the steps. This time it added but won't save vax status.,1
LYLE GARRETT,"I wouldn't call it user-friendly - I had to re-install it on both Samsung phones several times, just so I could pre-load traveller data. Passport uploads worked a charm, uploading the vax certs as files (.pdf or .jpg) didn't work worth a hoot. What DID WORK was printing the vax certs and taking pix of them with the app - that solved the problem. So now we're ready for our mini-vacay in a couple of weeks - then we'll see how the rest of the programme works out (but we'll be taking paper copies of our vax certs JIC ;) ) I agree with the reviewer who had trouble resetting a passwork - that too took several attempts.",3
Ron Boughton,GARBAGE APP This app is only good if you have the newest device. Anyone with an older phone or computer will not be able to use this app or the web online version either . Disgusting that we have to use this to get in our own country.,1
Marin Slavtchev,Worked everytime I needed it,5

Loynel Foo,"Simply the best app to be on,if you travel near or far!!",5
M Allen,"Just like the government to make a broken app. It doesn't recognize my second dose paperwork as valid, so it says I'm not vaccinated. How about make it so it works properly then release it.",1

Merci,gracias,thank you Canada",5
Lym Leo,"Traveller information is not saved on the app, I have tried multiple times, it says it's saved but then it disappears. That when the uploading of Vaccination proof works because sometimes it just reaches an 80% and then it gets stuck",1

Bee 963,Can't donwload it absolute terrible app,1
Tim Cumming,"I had some trouble completing the input of my information, the app kept freezing right at the end of the process. It took a few tries but it worked in the end. This was the first time I've crossed the border by car in more than two years, so I was a bit apprehensive about the process. When I returned to Canada after visiting the US to pick up a package the border crossing agent scanned my passport as usual. I was ready to show him the ArriveCan code on my phone, my vaccine info or anything else he might request; he said he already had it, the info is all linked to my passport. A couple more of the customary questions and I was on my way in less than a minute. The app made crossing the border back into Canada a breeze!",4
Bashar Kadhim,Horrible,1
Barbara Fisher,"Awful experience, it saved no information, didn't upload my proof of vaccination and keeps kicking me out of the app. Bugs need fixing.",1
Bob Tate,App won't save. Been at 80% for 2 days now. Good job Canada,2

King Dan,This app is garbage because it's forced upon us poor Canadians who want to live our lives by a scumbag dictator. Yes I mean trudeau and he should be in prison.,1
Dalton Edwards,Excellent!,5
Ricky Quan,App states that my device does not meet minimum security requirements even though my phone is not rooted. Android 11 on OnePlus phones are being blocked by the app.,1
Ray Dho,"Why isn't the information stored on a cloud?Why is it only local to 1 device?Means if I lost my device and log onto another one I won't be able to access my submitted info and the code required to enter?Why does the code expire, knowing that people will not reach the port of entry at the exact time that they put because of waiting times?App also freezes.Fix the glitches+ensure the codes are working for users as this has caused many issues on the border with no fault of anyone but the developers.",1
David,I added myself as a Traveller but would like to upload a better resolution picture of my vaccination card. Nowhere in the Travellers section I see my info. Nor can I add or edit the information of family members. What can I do.,4
Michelle Loves Jesus,This app sucks. I went to the US by land for less than 72 hours and I am fully vaccinated and it keeps telling me to quarantine and it sends me emails every day to complete symptom check in. I called the government number and they said I have to just wait it out. This app is super annoying.,1
Konstantin Bereznyakov,"The major flaw of the app is that you need a ""live"" wifi or data connection to open an existing submission if you've closed the app or restarted your phone. This may not always be feasible when returning from abroad. The app needs to be able to use an ""offline"" storage for displaying the most recent submission. This could be critical for some ""technologically challenged"" people. Also, the ""saved traveller"" feature could be significantly improved with a simple checkbox ""save traveller info for future use"" during a regular submission. Otherwise it is rather easy to just proceed with a ""one-time"" submission and to have to re-enter all the documents/vaccination details again next time.",3
David Conway,Not always responsive and doesn't register all inputs.,2
Don Smiley,"This app doesn't recognize my email address and password, very frustrating",2
Karen Anderson,"Much like others are saying, it's a buggy app. Won't accept my verification code, I do not have extra spaces, won't resend a verification code (no it is not in my spam/junk). Had to close and try to login for it to pop-up and say it's not verified and sent me another code finally - which was also not accepted, even though copied and pasted. Ticket submitted.",1
Randolph Webb,Do not work only frezees up at 80 percent loaded !!!!!,1
Parthiv Trivedi,Good,5
Mike Kunze,"How low a rating can I give this app? On both of my Samsung Android devices this app is useless. Important parts of windows that have items that MUST be clicked do not show up, preventing completion of the process with this app. You have to use the web version of Arrivecan to complete the process. Do not bother with this app. Use the Chrome browser and the web version of Arrivecan if you have the same issue I had with the app. Update to my review: The 11/28 update has the same issue",1
Jonathan Cooper,Almost got quarantined 14 days due to this lousy app not working properly....thank you to the border agent for not doing so!!!!!,1
Jill Storey,Arrived at the border today and the app would not work we were told we would have to quarantine for 14 days despite having our paper copies of vaccination proof and our registration for entry into NB. Finally my cousin was able to reach her husband who was able to do it from NB. It would not upload my photo of the vaccination so the border agent accepted the PAPER copy I had in my hand the entire time. The app is useless if it doesn't work.,1
Darlene Baumgartner,They should allow people to show documents at border. NO EVERYONE HAS INTERNET!!! THINK OF THE ELDERLY,1
Linda Wheeler,Not working I cannot enter my advance info,1

Kirita Esmeralda,"This app doesn't allow me to sign in, it says my password is wrong, and is not What a frustration!",1
Bari Kobari,This app failed multiple times to scan my passport. Manual attempt to enter info also failed. It's linear design wont allow to go to the next step so could not enter vaccination info. Now despite being fully vaccinated and having a negative PCR result I've been placed under quarantine for 14 days. That's 14 days of my life I lost and I'll never get back because of this substandard app.,1
James ARNOTT,I have tried to reset my password now for 3 hours and have had no success. From looking on line this is not a one off situation. As if there is not enough confusion on the ever changing regulations we seem to have difficulty in maintaining the systems that are now required.,2

French Tourist,"Can not see the ""I understand"" for ""no PCR test"" page on my Samsung S9 (Android 10) and had to resort to using the online version to get QR code. Also I don't always know land border crossing beforehand so then what?",2
Neil Goodman,"Has anyone that developed this app actually tried to use it on an Android PHONE?? When you get to the screen where is asks if you have had a negative PCR test in the last 72hrs & you answer ""No"" (because you are a Canadian citizen who is exempt from the test requirement for trips to the US < than 72hrs), the app then brings up a ""warning screen"" that you have to acknowledge. Unfortunately, the acknowledgement button is NOT VISIBLE at the bottom of the screen. Same situation for 2 different phones - Galaxy S8 / Galaxy Note 11. You are then dead in the water & can't complete your submission. The ONLY way we were finally able to resolve getting past this screen was to try for a THIRD time on an Samsung tablet, where everything displayed properly. After an hour of failed attempts on 2 phones. And yes, I have submitted this as an ""issue"" :-(",1

I have neither of those things. I'm not rooted and I'm running Android 11 which was pushed from OnePlus. Anyone else had this happen?",1
Wendy Ralph,This is a ridiculous app to set up. Three times I asked for the required verification code and three times it failed. Just figures Government would set you up for failure.,1
PAVNEET KAUR,Dear Sir I can't able to download this app.,1
AlleyCat Hamze,Originally I complained about not getting the QR code. I was doing something wrong. My mistake. All good. Thanks for the app,5
Tom,so far not really impress since this is currently a requirement to re-enter Canada you would think the govermnemnt would make it user friendly and ensure it can be accessed on and offline. The app doesn't even remember the password so now it forces people to use asimple on they remember. They want people to use vaccine with pasport but this doesn't read the QR code you upload a file or image. Lots of room for improvement,3
Neo Caines,500 mb for a vaccine verification app for travel? That's absurd. Who designed such utterly bloated software?,1

Doug Walker,"Not well thought out at all. Some questions not clear. No summary before hitting submit. Camera setup for vaccine passport photo is awful. Terrible app overall but you have no choice but to use it. The response from ArriveCan was simply a link to a help page - the offer to understand what the issues are was ignored. I stand by my review of what a terrible application this is, including associated processes.",1

Brian Smith,"The app doesn't permit the user to review all the input data required (familiarization) BEFORE actually inputting a trip plan. The data we did input when travelling was only held in the app for executing the travel plan and then was lost. Now the app permits storing basic passport and vaccination proof shortly after we processed ours. I kept expecting to have to upload to the app our PCR test results taken in advance, from feedback provided here, so I thought I did it wrong. Nope!? just had to show the PDF to the CBSA agent who was very good BTW. Top marks to him! Then early this morning I get a warning from QUARANTINE -Covid 19 that does not apply to me and after my fellow traveler had complied, completed the random test and received notification of negative results. It's Health Canada's obligation to use current information and a thank you note for compliance works way better than the threat of penalty for those of us that have done it right!. Emails that are irrelevant , makes the sender appear incompetent. This app should have a step by step tutorial available, or have the app allow you to walk through each step to familiarize. I now have to coach fellow travelers in our resort community. CBSA please pass this constructive feedback on to Health Canada!",3

F. Angus,"I scanned my passport as requested. The app registered my name, DOB and passport #. It then recorded my answers to the questions about both of my vaccinations. I then tried several times to upload photos of my proof of vaccination. I took clear, legible photos of the Covid-19 Proof of Vaccination document issued to me in BC, listing full info about the vaccine, lot numbers & dates, and my Health Cda QR code. The app says I have not uploaded proof of vaccination. FRUSTRATING!! What do I do?",2

Bob Vandrish,I tried many many times to get registered and for one reason or another was not able to do so! I have both vaccines and a booster and took a PCR test just before trying to cross and still ended up being quarantined for 14 days.

Sheilagh Burke,Have downloaded the app on my iPad and phone. When I sign in with my email address and password it says it’s incorrect on both devices. Tried to reset password and I was supposed to get a verification code but they never sent one. Can’t get any further. Very frustrating!,1
Anthony Spittachine,"Decant functionality however it does not allow for vaccine entry for those under 12 despite roll out to children and automatic import of passport sometimes generates errors in names, etc.",4
Mike Birmingham,"This app is utter garbage. As many other reviewers have complained, it does not recognise the correct email address and password when I try to enter them (and no, I have not put any spaces and I have not used the ""+"" symbol!). When I then ask it to reset my password, it says it has sent me an email - which never arrives. Same problem with the web version. Utter garbage. Is this really the best that Canada can do?!",1
Dallas Devam,Nazi tool for scared sheep. Shameful!,1

John cford,After a bit of work I was able to get the app to work as designed. Glad they are updating it for future travel.,4
Darryll Sulymka,App cuts off text and wants you to agree. Documents submitted are checked at board so the only point of app is to waste your time. Thanks Canada,1

Marlene Mundreon,Tried installing twice and does not allow to create an account. So how does one create an account in order to sign in???????,1
Suzanne Longpre,Can't complete the form. The page where you confirm that you do not need a pcr test to re-enter Canada under 72 hours is too big for the screen and so you cannot click to continue. Will there be an update for Android users?,1
Daniel Chartier,Excellent,5
Karuna Ausman,Easy to use and consumer friendly,5
Julie Kelly,"Was stranded yesterday at the border because it is still requiring the PCR test on the form. Uninstalled several times, checked for updates, still no luck. I was told at the border there was nothing they could do. Our opening of the border shouldn't be determined by bugs in an app. Hopefully this is sorted soon.",2
Billy Dean,Cannot enter border location. Letters are doubled.....e.g. Llccoollllee. No way to import from list of border locations. High grief for day trip to upstate NY. Have vax rCode and issued paper from vax location. Should be enough....get practical.,1

Carol Richardson,"If you have used app successfully for previous visit and you have forgot your password, function to reset password through sending code through my email did not work after many attempts. When driving through border in November-21 got a nasty surprise at border from bully custom inspector who said just to continue to try in enter information then threatened me with fine. (he was given hc of my covid test and federal documentation that |I had both vacs) Do these agents have any education what-so-ever on this app have called my MP, Canada is not police state. When app is installed first screen should give telephone number to call 24/7 for assistance.",1
Dion Mcarthur,"Im getting alerts to quarantine and I'm fully vaccinated. I called them and they said to ignore them, they are aware it's a problem. There is no way to update and review the info in the app.",1
Michelle Davis,Overall easy to use but when the app updated all my travellers & trips were deleted. I noticed a lot of people actually have issues submitting the time of their flight. I had the same issue but realized it's because I was trying to submit the form prior to the 72hr window of my arrival in Canada. Having a pop-up notification tell you this in the app would be greatly beneficial to the user experience.,4
Francisco Mejia Mastertax,Very good 👍,5
John Alves,Filled out app today with new rules in place wit no PCR test required for trips under 72 hours and the app asked if I have a pcr test and I entered no then it gives me pop up window that the trip is under 72 hours a canadain citizen and vaccinated I enter ok and it won't let me go any farther then that I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it and did it again go I entered that I have a PCR test and I got it completed but had to lie about it so will u guys update the app please,1
Onunks Uche,"Am not happy with the app when your sent a verification code it says wrong code or no internet connection, meanwhile i input the right code and i have a very strong internet connection, i don't like how this app is frustrating me because i need to submit all my details before I get to Canada.",1
Todd Bonacci,Won't accept verify code. PC won't accept code either on numerous browsers. Therefore I cannot use my account or submit information to travel. Completely useless. This is why people get upset with our government. Good For You. Ticket submitted.,1

les dorgo,"Does not save your information. If you make multiple trips you will need to reenter your basic info every single time. The app is completely separate from the e-declaration app. Would be amazing if it would save your info and combine the E-declaration app, it would save time at land borders. The app could tell people what lanes to go into. I hope for an update that allows these 3 features.",3

Very frustrating, confusing, time consuming and unacceptable.",1
Ali Ahad,"Not sure what the point of the app is since none of the border officials actually care to look at it. You can't even upload your test documents which I thought was the whole point of it.

Caro Coltman,"Ridiculous. You cannot enter and upload information before leaving Canada without lying about your border crossing date. You do so. Then, you update it with your actual border crossing. The next day just as you are crossing the border you triple check to find that the app requires further confirmation (despite previous saves). Then, someone in your party is randomly selected for a 'take-home' Covid test. Guess what? You will need to upload everything into another app which is also buggy.",1

Just keep on trying in the app and web site. Agent said they were open until midnight. Tried calling back and they were already closed at 6:20pm mountain time.

Completed everything before my flight including details of both my vaccinations, negative PCR test, did all the right steps, border officer confirmed my partner & I did not need to quarantine on arrival. Then started getting quarantine notifications, followed it up & was told several times that I had not entered my vaccine details when i had... Everything got sorted but app desperately needs fixing.",1

Miriam Rivas,Will not allow me to enter proper return time. Ridiculous!,1
Asma Syed,Not compliant with new federal laws. Do you think it might be wise and advisable for you to update your app to comply with the country's own laws? You are causing situations of dress for people who are trying to reenter into their home country. Isn't that the whole basis of this app? How ridiculous for you to be behind your own federal regulations.,1
GJ Danco,"poorly thought out...does not allow for other family members such as spouse and children...edit...after a response from developer, I will state the app is still poorly thought out with little help to muddle through👎👎👎..(edit#2...and another response from developers over a week later...long after when we needed the support and couldnt get it. Typical with government funded programs such as this one...where is the less than 1 star rating icon?",1
Andrew Philp,So easy to use as a foreign traveller. Wish the UK could write software like this.,5
Joe Bobczynski,Hi I'm having trouble logging in. 1st of all the app did work last year. I've been off and just come back trucking. Now I cannot log in. I use my email and then I hit forgot password. So it sends me a code. So the app knows my email. I put the code number in and I reset my password. So it thinks and says Signin failed check email on or password and internet connection. I have reset it a few times and turned off my phone. Do you how to fix it so I can login. Thanks got it fixed Thks.,4

Had never heard of ArriveCAN, but someone created an account with my email address. Now, I can neither access my apparent account nor set up an account. When I use ""Forgot Password,"" no email is sent to me with a verification code. Is this a legitamite, government app? I hope I haven't introduced something bad into my devce.",1

Tatiana Lobanok,Terrible experience. As a fully vaccinated traveller with negative PCR test I completed the form using this application. Then I was stotmed by emails requiring to quarantine and then I was contacted by the Government of Canada agent who threatened me to call a police because I entered Canada without proof of vaccination! Maybe it is me who should call a police or a lawyer and complain about the threats I am receiving from the public servant who is supposed to protect me?,1
Sandy McKay,pretty easy-to-use,5
Trey Bohne,Why do we need an app to submit information we already have copies of? I do all this just to get to Canada and most of the border service agents don't ask for it anyway. The one I did give it to just gave it right back and said he didn't need it...,1

Info was already input so I didn't have to show anything, all data must have been linked to my person/passport. Didn't even need to show the QR Code or anything at all. A man of my word, I will update it to 5 stars. I don't see the need for this. I guess I can review again after going through the airport. 5 stars if I only have to show my ArriveCAN receipt. 1 star if the receipt means nothing at all to anyone and I have to answer all these questions again.",5

Asks for proof of vaccination then there is a separate process to show proof of PCR test. Why not do everything at once?,1

It's like no one cared that I used this app.",2
Geoffrey Bell,"kicked me.out, started over 4 times",1

We now are getting the emails that my husband should be in isolation we are both double vaccinated and had a negative test in Cuba before returning home. At the airport there was no issues border control person did not look at the app.you would think that the app/public health could cross reference the fact of double vaccination.,1
yadwinder singh,its a good app...easy to use and straight forward queations. one thing i am confused about is if 5 years or younger is not required to get vaccination then why in the app there is a question regarding their vaccination...if they are vaccinated or not ?? i think app should pick up this from date of births entered and excludes 5 yrs or under from that very question.. otherwise app is very good and easy to use.,4

Kausar shah,not to straight forward. too long questions,3
MrKolan007,Easy to use!,5
Noah Hepworth,I have a slight question to go along with my review. Can developer confirm if reusable receipts for exempt travel are still available. Prior to reusable receipt I think that when putting in entry location should be able to also use port # to search in conjunction with crossing name.,4
Hugo Guerrero Oliva,"I am supposed to upload my digital documents? The app just asked me to scan my passport, not my Covid-19 vaccination certificate. I am going for trade & transport purposes. Why I couldn't to upload the rest of my documents?",3
Murphy Lwesibawa,This is the fastest arrival checking in I have recieved so far compared to other airports during this pandemic era.,5
David Martin,The worst possible piece of software. Whoever signed off on this application should be fired immediately,1
Rose Buds,For my 79yrs old head this app is nothing but stress on my old brain.,1
Lucas Segall,"There should be a way to re confirm that you are double vaccinated so that you aren't re-prompted to answer the questions every day. Had numerous people calling from different sources asking about my quarantine plan and asking me about a follow up covid test when I told so many people at customs, etc that I am vaxxed, yet am not receiving the proper follow up on your end. This app could have solved that issue if it functioned properly.",2
Stephen Farr,"Poorly designed. It does not allow you to upload passport, nexus, or vax status in advance of 72 hours of a return to Canada. Why can't I permanently upload this well in advance?",1
John,"The app works very well, fast and easy.",5
William Boivin-Villeneuve,"Finally got it to work on my gf's phone (Iphone/using wifi and not mobile data maybe?). Bet the border services wont even bother to ask for it.. edit: I was asked for the QR code from the app about 5 times during my trip, except for the border services lol... (photoshop couldve propably worked as nobody scanned the QR code).",1
Samer Darwiche,Was refused boarding because application was down last time i flyied.,1
Donovan Williams,Easy to use,5
Pamela Pesek,"To qualify as a fully vaccinated traveller to Canada, you must: have received at least 2 doses of a Government of Canada-accepted COVID-19 vaccine or a mix of 2 accepted vaccines or at least 1 dose of the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccine Under these guidelines set out on travel.gc.ca I am fully vaccinated. I kept getting harassed on a daily basis, sometimes twice because I did not fulfill a covid swab on day 8. The amount of anxiety that this caused was absolutely soul crushing. Shame on you.",1
John Brooks,The app runs smoothly and it worked successfully. I'm glad they fixed the issue where it would complain about my arrival date being in the future (duh!),4
Cassie,super straightforward and simple to fill out.,5
Jo Jewell,When the app doesn't work the agent told me it's mandatory to complete the app and if it's not working then I have to wait until I can submit my information. Why should I be inconvenienced if the app fails? I have all of my documents hardcopy!,1
Kevin Cappon,"I don't think fully vaccinated Canadians should have to jump through so many hoops just to come home. I had to pay 173 dollars for the stupid PCR test. make unvaccinated Canadians take a test to come home not vaccinated Canadians. Edit: Here is an excerpt from the link you sent me as of Oct 27 2021 All travellers 5 years of age or older, regardless of citizenship or vaccination status, must: provide proof of a COVID-19 negative molecular test result to enter Canada",1
Mark Grygar,easy to complete,5

W T,Important app for most people if they want to visit Canada.,5
Cap'n Limpworm,"Sod off, ya gits!",1
Cathy Roberts,fairly straight forward and easy,5
Joel Fountain,Please make it so it saves traveler information like vaccines and passport and address etc. There's no need for us to refill the same exact data everytime we cross.,1
Tom Bernard,It would be helpful if the app explained the arrival procedure ie how you enter your customs declaration,4
Terry Miller,easy to use,5
Ijeoma Onah,am not getting a PM time option so my time instead of 420PM is showing am,4
Richard Crotty,the time of arriving flight interface is awful,4

Andrew Dennison,Worked fine first try.,5
Khalil Ahmed,bästa,5
ifrit53227,"This was stressful to fill out, now that I experienced filling out the ArriveCan info. It asked a lot of questions, some annoying and somewhat invasive. Then there's a disclaimer at the end warning of penalties if I don't adhere to COVID-19 protocol, including fines and imprisonment. Not fun. I can see why some people are against COVID-19 vaccine passports. I survived this long with no issues, cuz I followed the science all along. Pro mask, and 3 shots of Pfizer. I'm ready to travel already!",2
Dr. JAGDEEP FOZDAR,Easy and simple to fill,5
c a.c. n,Awful. Needless. Can't wait to uninstall,1
Isabelle Sauve,vraiment trop long et compliqué,2
Alicia Unger,"I cannot submit my travel profile, either on the app or online. It just doesn't work, says I don't have internet but I do..",1
Gord C,The website requires filing within 2 days of travel. That is imposible in a weekend when covid test places are closed. I filled out a paper copy at the departing airport. But it was not recognized at Montreal arrival. Very POOR set up.,2
paul yqg,very glitchy,1
Mariah,you have to refill your information Every single time with no option to save info,1
Savita N,This is the most stressful app I've ever had to deal with first to create an account they need to send a verification code to my email I searched my email for over an hour and nothing ever came I try resend verification code option and it says they are unable to send one try again later my parents were traveling on an emergency and they missed the flight all because this information was not submitted they had hell in getting through with this app too never got through,1
Scott King,"easy to use, straight forward",5
Wilmer Chaves,super,5
Wendy Pillar,"While the app seems to work as it should, it is extremely repetitive for people who are traveling frequently. I don't see why I can't just save my information rather than, for example, having to add a screenshot of my vaccination card every single time. The only thing that changes for me is the date of travel. I hope this can be remedied.",3
Hussein Al,Garbage. I tried to login and it didn't let me and tried to reset my password and didn't do it. I also tried to create another account using different email and kept telling me an account with this email already exists and when I tried to reset my password with all of them nothing happened. I tried more than 20 over 20 hours period with same result. I think it is another stresser before returning to your home,1
R Christinck,Horrible. Doesn't work properly. Filled in all my info properly. No issues at the border. THEN the phone calls start coming in asking about quarantine. I did not need to quarantine. The person who called me said the computer does not always recognize the uploaded documents and flagged me as quarantining. Very dissatisfied. What is the point in filling out the info?,1
Mananpreet Ahuja,ArriveCan is a good app.i strongly recommend it.,5
Leslie Haines,Sign in won't work. No email comes when trying to change password.,1
Angel Heaven,Not old people friendly. Just another bureaucracy and extra personal info leakage possibility. All these things are checked 10 times beforehand. People with guns are always right!,3
alexander davis,"Day 9 of quarentine. Each time I go to do my daily report, shows me the link that says ""find out if you can enter canada""... for real ?. Each day I click on the link from the email notification to submit my daily report... it shows green affirmation thanking me for filling it in ( prior days affirmation I guess ) I have to click notifications to see the link, click that in order to complete the report. Day 9... get notification. Open app and its lost my form and reports, yet I'm accountable ?",1

Aoife Murphy,"It just didn't work. Whenever I tried to open it after the initial login, the screen was blank. Had to uninstall and fill out the form online. Not recommended.",1
Y S,"The form first page text is not visible if phone is in the dark mode, very confusing. After turning the dark mode off everything works OK.",4
Ellen McNabb,Start forward to complete,4
Gaspar Mendes,"Didn't have any login issues reported by many. Filling out the form was straightforward as long as you have all info necessary (travel document, proof of vaccinations)",5
Nikhil Sukhdev,great app. Wonderful usability,5
Vania Vargas,"The app did not let us to continue filling in the whole questionnaire (2 people with two different phone plans) until we were in the airport almost in front of the immigration officer. I got the QR code until I had pass the officers. It did not work with the internet connection in Mexico, either in my house nor in the airport. Neither with the connection in the Vancouver's airport. In order to let us continue filling in the sections, we had to save and continue, go back and forth many times.",2
Philip Ward,very good,5
Gurmej Singh Canada,good,5
Greg Zhuk,works like intended and easy to use,5
Nexxtella Gmail,"Lengthy and repetitive tasks. Asks for details of vaccination doses then also asks to upload the vaccination certificates. Also, asks for proof of negative molecular test but doesn't ask to upload it. It's a good start but needs fixes.",4
Anatoly Ustyanich,"this app is not flexible and does not provide right options for user to pick from, as a result the info is not reflecting the actual situation. the app needs to be updated.",1

xpert squad,"it's fast, easy",5
Ivy Sun,First I want to say I do like the knowledge that people traveling are being held accountable with this app. Its good Except the auto fill on the address BS! Except when they are being harrassed due to the app messing up! Im double vaccd' and tested 3 times before coming home and i got flaged to quarentine. And now im getting emails and phone calls saying i need to check in. When i call or email i only get automated responces. I would like to talk to a human to get this harrasment to stop.,3

Keith Pittman,incredibly cumbersome and redundant,1
Beth Smith,easy to understand and follow.,5
Fahd Undre,"I usually don't simp for people or places, but in this circumstance I shall break that rule. I simp for Canada because I wish to enter and visit family with no issues along the way with an easy journey. that said this app was actually pretty easy to understand and adapt to, very clear instructions and it doesn't take long, it's sort of a pre prep of what you'd do before entering the plane anyway and hey you'd rather have your self together before the day rather than on the day. hence good job.",5
Mark Olson,very cumbersome,2
Andrew Black,"My situation is listed on their website as exempt, but no way to fill that out via arrive Can.",1
Edward Chen,Straight forward,5
A Google user,"This App is so messed up, a nightmare , just when you think you had it dowloaded, it kicks you off and when you get to the part just before the final questions, your out and there is no confirmation. And at the bottom of the site it ask you to report any problems and when you do, it tell you that you will not receive a confirmation ....excuse me !!!!!? Were tested negative on all the rapid and the PCRS, and we are quaranteeing , and we are still harrassed by an automated machines that only accept YES or NO for an answer....in the mean time the Raptors game was wide open to full capacity...how does that make sense. At the end ,the governement automated dummy that called us made the decision that we are not complying , what the...../#&**&%#@ .",1

Danielle Mitchell,Easy to use.,5
Katie Jia,"Awful experience. Followed everything and uploaded all our proof of vaccination, border patrol agent didn't even check it and said it wasn't working. Have been getting emails and calls about quarantine and it's stressing me out. I've called and emailed a bunch of different places with NO help. Absolutely fed up and pissed off at this system. Fix it. Unnecessary stress to travellers who did everything right is ridiculously disgusting.",1
Ty Yu,good,5
Norman MacIver,If you don't have a cell phone you can't come to Canada!,1
Sarah Moomey,Very easy to fill out and understand what is required,5

Rory Franssen-Moore,so easy,5
John Philip Henderson,Poor. What a ridiculous requirement. Everybody involved should be embarrassed,1

FRANCIS TERENZO,very easy,5

Patricia Diedrich,Very easy to fill out,5
Laurie Kinns,good,5
Tony Marshall,This app has been crashing for the last 24 hours. I can't get passed the first page. I land at 1404 on 10-19-2021 @ YYZ and not able to complete the arrival process. I have tried uninstalling and installing several times with no difference. Report has been filed.,1

Corey Barnett,this is a pain in the donkey.,2
Patrick Lemire,you can't upload your test results. stupid,1
Dianne christensen,Good,5
Frank Forrestall,This app completely malfunctioned. I thought I had completed all the forms properly but there were pages that it didn't show me and so when I tried to board my flight I was denied at check in. I'm presently stuck in Italy and this malfunction may cost me thousands of extra Dollars to get home. Don't waste your time with this. The Canadian government should stop endorsing it.,1
Brendan Smith,its a joke that we even need to use this app.,1
Garry Mitchell,"Overseas. Continually failed to recognize password or reset of password, but recognizes account exists. Useless. No contacts for problems with app.",1
Alice Vass,I have issues entering my daily report.,1
Sue Mitchell,"Tried to download load the app on my phone, after 12 hours of the wheel of death I gave up.",1

Dani Sarji,clear and easy to use,5
Andres Hernandez,This sucks big time. I didn't choose to have a layover in canada. It was my only option. This accomplishes nothing but annoying people. This does not makes anyone safer. Congrats for making canada annoying.,1
Michelle XiaoHan,"while overseas, I couldn't download qr codes nor the vaccine receipts for upload.",1
Taher Khambata,good app,5
Jo Ann Petrie,The online version worked well BUT would be better if there was a Save and Continue option for the basic information of the 1st Travelor needed rather than having to go through EVERYTHING over and over because of the quick sign-outs while waiting for required docs and test results during the 72 hour period before flight takes of ... that is rather nerve wracking ... our info could still all be deleted or edited 30 days after travel as promised.,4
Ahmani Johnson,Thanks to all working on the border! Let's get those communities back up & running! Bellingham misses their Canadian neighbours! 🇨🇦🇺🇲🌎 #SlowTheSpread,5
Nicole Vadnais,works great!,5

Marcos Loro,very good and easy to fill,5
Daryl Draper,"If I could give it a zero I would. The system is faulty. Fully vaccinated, negative test two days before returning, negative test again on arrival and yet the system is telling me I need 14 days of quarantine. Now I am receiving emails and notifications daily that I must report, but the most annoying is the threats via telephone...yesterday 12 phone calls. If this were a private company it would be called harassment. Maybe there is a case for that! The help line said this should not happen, but!",1
ys,Excellent!!!! Couldn't be easier to use!! Thank you for making this app so user friendly!,5
sanjit priyank,I have a problem after day 8 sample test it asks a question about taking the test but there is no answer space provided. Please help me with this because I think I am loosing some information that I need to report. I can share the screenshots if required.,5

Steve Montague,"Completely comprehensive, but necessary.",5
Valerie Kerry,App worked well for us.,4
Alex Cantin Lagace,"Could not make submission online, only succeeded through the app which is: 1. False Advertisement. 2. Huge security risk. Anyone want to get bets going on who, between the Chinese & Russians, will break into this app first? I'm putting my money on the russians. You'll have to provide a GRC certificate stamping this app as safe & hacker proof to keep anyone SANE from instantly deleting this app after receiving their receipts.",1
NZ WA,too detailed and border entry names are not standardized such as Peace arch vs. pacific highway.,4
Melanie Modrall,"Does not allow you to enter vaccination information, even after updating it. There's no way to contact anyone about this issue either. This is ridiculous.",1

Murray Campbell,"This app is terrible. The drop downs are a joke and for example, it would only accept Canada with a capital C.......otherwise it wasn't a valid country.",1
Mehdi Rifai,"Straightforward, kinda no brainer, which is good. Read the instructions carefully, though.",4
Pete Kennedy,It is very OPPRESSIVE! Why do need a PcR when an instant antigen is good enough for entry to most countries. Canadian citizens should not be threatened to be held off of boarding flights home for not completing this B. S. either. Canada has become a dictatorship and has started by losing our freedom of travel!,1
Scott Strang,"It's petty to give one star for this, but it's stupid for fully vaccinated travels to need a PCR test to enter the country.",1
Shannon Dowdall-Smith,"month of second dose glitched, I couldn't alter the month or type in the correct date, otherwise fine.",4
NetuserLC NetuserLC,Clunky! Does not migrate information between devices. Could not enter information for travel to other countries,3
Lori Gibbs,"1st time using the app. Many pages of questions. Easy to select and add documents but get to the page ""in the last 14 days, did you visit any other country besides xxxx"" and there is no button to say ""yes"" or ""no"". Do you test this program before publishing?",1
Sylvia Regina,"I am absolutely SHOCKED by the inefficiency of this App. I was UNABLE to fill up this App in the country where I came from. It would not accept my passwords or any codes for password reset. That's absolutely unacceptable And I, as a tax payer, full time working professional of Canada, demand an explanation.",1

John Clark,Faulty,1
Sami El-Dib,Great app for travelers,5
M ZAK,Update: There are lot of bugs in the app. My flight is at 10:26 pm but user is unable to select pm and another bug is when user fills all the information and before submit tried to edit any field most of the field data disappears. Also a major requirement updates is after entering all the information the app won't let the user submit the form because the form needs to be submitted in 72 hours which should be displayed to user before hand.,3
Thomas Szczerba,Easy to navigate app.,5
Keith Levan,Really not that hard to fill out.,5
Tim Bartlett,"Quick and easy, less than 3 minutes to complete",5
Monir Imamverdi,Your date/time selectors are broken. Can't switch am to pm. How can something so basic be so broken.,1
Sapper31,I own nothing yet I am not happy. 2/10 great reset not as advertised.,1
Ahmed Shaikhon,It is a great app that makes our lives easier. The only issue is that the passport scanning using the camera can result in errors and you MUST double check the scanned details and fix errors manually.,4
Malcolm Ferreira,Awesome setup and easy to follow.,5

Vince Osborne,Doesn't work. Charged $65 for a free app.,1
Beth Lugger,Finally an app that is a pleasure to navigate. The photo upload feature was the best use of that technology for my challenged inputting to a format. THANK YOU from a Grandapa who did not have to call his granddaughter for help! 3rd,5
Susan Shiffer,"Love the step by step instructions. A couple things that keeps APp from getting all 5 stars is: 1. I don't recall seeing info in the ""Do you qualify to enter Canada"" that notified us of need for a neg COVID-19 tests done 72 prior until well into the APP. Not a deal breaker, as we were logically expecting to need neg tests. 2. Explain wht the calendar only show a few dates ahead if current date. We tried to start 12 weeks out and weren't sure why we couldn't pick a date further in the future.",4
John Martins,Can't seem to open an account,1
Harry Kashou,No good,1
Bernard Mercier,Very convenient,5
Ericha Harrold,still not sure if the person traveling with me should be listed on my app or their own. thought I could add them later but not sure if that effects my receipt of entry,3
Heba Abd ElKhalik,Great one,5

The Truth TV,"It's simple, straightforward and easy to fill.",5
Weihsin Chen,Cannot submit the form even if I apply within 72 hours. Looks like the app has some caching issue for the saved application.,1

James Litwin,"Very clumsy, good luck if one is a novice smartphone user. Took 45 minutes. Don't give up. Rotate to vertical.",2
Brian Mebus,"Worst experience ever. I did everything correct, and was sent an email for 14 day quarantine. The app has a glitch so sometimes even when you do it all perfect, it doesn't register correct. Get it together guys, i don't appreciate being threatened with quarantine or fines when they don't apply to me. Total BS",1
Elizabeth Carone,easy to fill out.,5

Thomas Braukmann,"Prepare for bugs. This app has issues with submission with crashing or issues submitting. Then once you submit be prepared for more issues. Despite being fully vaccinated and having uploaded my proof of vaccination, I am being asked to quarantine and fill out daily reports despite meeting the exemption requirements. I submitted the issue as a complaint over a government website but that yields no response. You could be lucky and have no issues but this app should not have a luck component.",1

jitesh bhatt,Misleading,1
Drax Conn,Absolutely garbage,1
Luis Figueiras,Excellent app,5
Danilo Azevedo,Requiring old-fashioned PCR tests and a quarentine plan from fully vaccinated travellers is so 2020. Take yellow fever travel requirements as a proper example of how to avoid contagion due to travel without bothering lawful citizens with bureaucracy and lab-induced lobbying.,1

Prandeo Sahay,Not used yet but will need soon as I will travel to Canada.,3
Carol Tyndaal,"If I could rate this app zero I would. It was a very harrowing experience. I tried for one full week during my vacation and the app kept circling me back to the list of countries even though I already picked the country I'm leaving (Canada) the country I'm going to (US) and the country I'm returning to(Canada). So because the Arrive Canada App was not done, I was forced to fill out an equally annoying form at Pearson International Airport. What a horrible experience. It just ruined my vacation😑",1
Simon Borrou,"Great App but MAKE SURE you have all docs acanned and saved to your phone, or image files of the docs you need. You will need to goggle search addresses to enter as well, so don't close the App accidently.",4
Tobias Oke,"Its saying my email or password is incorrect or that my internet isn't working when I'm making the account and putting in the verification code, don't see how it could be wrong when I'm just making it now, and the online version on the govt.

Hany Soliman,pretty totalitarian stuff.,1
Ali K,crashes sometimes,2
D MV,"Easy enough to set up. I'm primary, added my spouse. Get to the border - they tell me my husband ""completed his paperwork"" - where is my pw. Well, this is confusing, neither of us completed paperwork. The border agent now gets pissed, because her line is being held us. I explain, neither of us completed pw. I did this app. She says, only your spouse shows. Now, we need to go into the Customs Bldg & straighten it out. Get in there, no wifi - we were right in the long run, we were right. #pain",4
Linda Everett,So easy and quick to set up and use,5
Abraham Morales,intuitive and time saver at the boarder,5

How am I supposed to require to follow regulations when the system is failing. I have even tried registering with multiple email accounts.,1
william bebb,"It works, but it didn't remember me from previous uses, so it also doesn't work (IMHO). it takes a while to complete, and you also need physical evidence of everything you enter into it, I would love the government to make something that is an ""all-in-one"" app...but it does what the Canadians want sooo it works fine.",5
Doug Wright,Pretty straightforward... Just follow the instructions...,5
Terry Crewes,Very Straightforward App.,5
Anita Lalonde,"Won't let me enter Travel info frozen on that page so not able to finish process, so frustrating.",1

Mahipesh Satija,"easy to operate and fill information, fast processing and no lags.",5
Tony Schmidt,"This app sucks. Upon entry into Canada (Toronto Pearson Int'l), it would not allow me to proceed past question about any other countries visited (which was none). I tried 3 times and one of the customs agents was unable to get it to move past that question. Thankfully this agent was very helpful and helped us do paper copies at his station. Since then I have tried to update this app twice and it still locks up at that exact same point. Whoever is responsible for making this app work properly needs to fix this problem, as it almost caused my wife and I to miss our flight from Toronto to Calgary.",1
Dana Edgell,"there doesn't seem to be a way to save much information, or begin with a previous trip. so you end up entering the same info again. It does save one page of your travel info (but not that of your kids traveling with you). It does not save your covid vaccination info. It does not let you edit a previously submitted trip if you decide to change time of crossing or entry point, etc.",3
Kyle Meister,"Just something as simple as trying to change my arrival time from AM to PM is impossible in this app. As in, it is stuck on AM by default and cannot be changed to PM.",2

S CW,"Worst application ever. Worked once, now it simply doesn't submit your information (hangs at a random percentage, then always at 16%). Does not tell you what is wrong, just an obscure error code. Regardless of being fully vaccinated with recent negative PCR tests, you cannot fly into Canada without the arriveCAN receipt..even if it is their fault, not mine, that this piece of trash doesn't work.",1
Nathan Eedy,I had to try to get it to submit for hours. meanwhile internet connection is perfect. talk about stressful.,1

Madhusudhan Madhusudhan,I tried using the App and entered the arrival date as oct 11 2021 everything works fine at the end when i click submit it says arrival date not valid. Then how was i able to choose it in thr first place. I need tech support as my mom is arriving on 11 October and Im in Canada trying to help her as she is not tech savvy,2

Gabriel Sanvido,The form could not be submitted with error 200,1
Michael,"After filling out dozens of pages, the app won't submit those with cryptic 200 error saying to check internet connection (which is fine). btw online version gives an error on documents upload too. It's not only a bug, but travelling back put at big risk. At least give me an option to fill this out at the airport of arrival, if the app always throws errors.",1
me andyou,Kept getting failed submission error and to check my internet connection. I am home and internet is working fine. Tried the website version and still failed at the vaccine card upload. This is horrible to make it a requirement to use the App or website where both are not working probably.,1
Sujan Adhikari,I tried to sign in with 2/3 different email ID but I am not able to sign in.My travel date is very near but I am unable to sign in. Every time it shows check your email address and password and that your device is connected to the internet. I am in dilemma what to do.Please response as soon as possible.,1
James Lekander,Quite difficult for me being untrained on the internet.,3
Lorna O. Davison,Very nice app.,5
Lucrecia E. Choto,Although this app is easy to use it does not provide options for people entering to solely go to Tsawwassen Ferry to pick up someone and to leave immediately. There needs to be a process for those of us who are literally a day or hourly visitor out of necessity.,3

Adam O'Brien,"I hate Canada, country of morons run by morons.",1
Joe Weiss,"The app clearly states that if you've had a negative Covid test within 72 hours, you don't need a quarantine plan. Yet you can't exit and submit your completed app UNLESS you have a quarantine plan completed. So if you've had your (negative) test, then you have to make up something to put in the plan, which might be a risk, since not telling the truth is an offense. But there is no other way to do it. Does anyone do any usability testing?",3

Ron Stevens,upload image scan of passport or Nexus did not work,3
Ron Yahne,"Super frustrating! The screen freezes every time I get to the travel history page. I tried reinstalling and same problem. I tried tech support and never got anyone to answer. I tried the contact us help but kept getting the same message that they couldn't evaluate if I was exempt, not what I was asking! Circular nonsense trying to deal with this!",1
Nermin Karajic,The worst app and customer service ever. Travelled to Europe and could not sign in into app or browser (chrome and opera) and because of a time difference it takes a full day to get a response and after couple emails all they had to say is we are aware of the problem and working to resolve it that's it and I'm stuck at the airport and they won't let me on a plane without a code that you are supposed to get after filing applications so don't really on government's help it's not coming,1

John MacIntyre,"Great idea, but took me forever to submit. Kept getting an error at 16% with a 200 error code, which based on other errors, I believe that's a http success status, which means it was probably a validation error that's being handled incorrectly. If you get an error at 16% with a 200 code, you might want to verify there's nothing that wouldn't fail validation and resubmit.",3

I had so trouble with the app last year when We came home, I'm scared to holiday this year and get stuck AGAIN because of this app. Why can't I download my vaccination information now, before I leave Canada, so at least I know it's there. I had a heck of a time trying to figure this out for My husband and I when we came home from Mexico last year. Worst app ever!",1
Joëlle Vitzikam,"On top of the problems listed by other people, I get emails every couple days asking me to register even though I did already, and when I do the daily symptom check up, the days are wrong. I landed on the 12 and not on the 27 it tells me it's day 14 of the quarantine instead of day 15... (Edit 29th September 2021) One year later and this app is still pretty much unusable.

Paul,easy,4
Bob Barto,Program was clear and instructions were easy to follow.,5
Sanford Ohren,"Horribly complicated and off-putting; uses obscure language & outdated information. Links are circular, leading no where (e.g., prompt to update the app). figuring this mess out is hopeless! It must mean Canada does not really want US visitors at this time! Most ridiculous is the 72-hour pre-entry Covid-19 test results, when most all testing sites say results take up to 5 days! Thus results are impossible to predict, so no can accurately plan travel eligibility. (Exception: NW Labs in B'ham).",1

Zee Bilwani,easy to use.,5
Dale Morency,Easier than before,3
Howard Kennedy,"The app needs a way to store your vaccination records. The is my 3rd time using it and I have to upload a new document every time. Also, the standard file download from the Govt of Ontario cannot be uploaded because the app says the file is too large. Also, there is no way to upload your covid test so you have to rely on having a piece of paper to do that (the Verifly app seems to manage that process easily).",1

Milan Jurga,"This app has a broken logic. It uploaded my vaccination poof, but for some reason created a wrong receipt. Customs officer on arrival to Canada ignored the ArriveCAN receipt anyway and requested hard copy of vaccination proof. I was allowed to enter Canada exempted from quarantine requirements, but the ArriveCAN app incorrectly flagged the government that I am in quarantine.

H AbdulHameed,Great app Everything OK,5
Eddie Ho,"As a frequent traveller the app needs a lot of improvements. The app does not save your vaccination records and addresses, even though you have to log in. You have to re-upload your vaccination record and addresses every time you enter. There should be an option to allow you to save your records for re entry. Furthermore the app does not allow you to upload covid test results. If these are fixed the app will be better.",1
Lucky L,I've been trying for 2 days to complete the process. On the website and app I'm stuck on step 12 of 13. Can't send data on website and the app doesn't advance.,1
Nate Baker,It would be nice to have multiple receipts or if the old ones automatically deleted after 14 days or something.,4
Daniel Cordis,"The number one worst thing about this app is that it doesn't work without an internet connection. When I was traveling back to Canada from Europe the only place they actually ask you to see your ""receipt"" is before you board the plane coming into Canada, and if you're connecting through some random country and don't have a SIM card with data or free wifi at the airport then you're screwed unless you printed out or saved the confirmation emails. The app will just ask you to log in if no connectio",1

Vivek Raman,"Doesn't work well. There was no technical difficulty or error while using the app. I have mentioned the dates of the vaccinations, negative test results, etc. etc. But still it was asking for the quarantine plan? I got confused and started to fill the details from the beginning, again the same issue. Tried again. Fourth time, filled the details for the sake of filling it. Does not look like the app is getting updated inline with the government directives. Or the authorities should have included clarifications like, if I develop some symptoms do I have plan to quarantine? Or Just incase for unknown reasons if I required to be quarantined, do I have a plan?.... These kinds of clarifications would have avoided the confusions. Thanks",2
Marva Zulay Castillo,"So for the last 5 days trying to access ArriveCan on my phone or online has been futile doesn't give me access either it says error on the phone app or keep sending me to the login screen on the website, after 2 calls with customer service in Canada 🇨🇦 didn't help and here still waiting 🤔 and very concern how am I going to go back home in 2 days if the bloody app does allow me to get in.

Richard monk,Won't let me sign in 90% of the time. Edit. If i could rate that auto gen reply 1 star i would. Absolutely useless app that doesn't work 90% of the time and is absolutely pointless with the amount of phone calls emails and check ins you receive.

Julietti S.,easy to use!,5
Mitchell Martin,App out of date!! Needs revision as 14 day quarteen now required now!,1
Joel Hutton,the site should start with YOU NEED A PCR TEST NOT A RAPID TEST. Also it only allows you to enter the date of arrival 4 days before. This info is critical. I wish I could give this site 0 stars it almost cost me alot of money. I shouldn't have to Google how to get back into my own country. Thats the sites purpose.There are rapid tests everywhere and most countries accept them. I am double vaxed. I also have to get a PCR test within 72 hours. Lab times can be long and there can be other delays.,1

Don't rely on the app to care about nuances or ambiguities related to Arrive""'ing in ""CAN""'ada (ArriveCAN), it's just not that well-made. Got to the airport after paying $200 for a ""rapid"" COVID-19 test (must be taken within 72 hours of departure) only to be turned away at the gate. BRING YOUR PASSPORT, NOT YOUR PASSPORT CARD!!!",1

When I entered my credentials again all my previous information wasn't there. Infact I was being asked arrival date like I was just using it afresh. What can be done?,1
A Ali,"The app was a bit glitchy for me (used it to check in daily after August 27th). It would always sign out (understandable, no problem) but it would usually take 2-3 sign in attempts, login using autofill, to actually sign in. Sometimes I would receive an error message and still be signed in. It has messed up my quarantine day number once. I can't view previously entered information further on (e.g. I needed my arriveCan receipt # for my day 8 covid test, thankfully I had a screenshot).",4
Larry Grella,pretty easy to use,5
Jono MacDougall,Easy to fill in. Love the passport scanning. overall good app though would work just as well as a website.,5

Dennis Bossard,"Log in was clumsy, some I could not load correctly.",2
Lisa Sedore,Unnecessary!! Not used properly by our government!,1
Tamara Richter,"I tried to submit 69 hours prior to my flight and it would not work. I waited and did it again 57 hours prior and it worked. Not sure the difference and I restarted my phone, the app and tried to complete many times.",1
Karin Mladenovic,Highly recommend you use this app. important to note that you should only complete 72 hours prior to departure. App is time sensitive and you may find some info does not load if you update earlier. example- your flight details and time of arrival. I feel confident that this process will save me time at passport control! Thank you.,5
A Vagenas,"Always signs you out. Try signing in fails first time. Try signing in a second time it succeeds but still displays sign-in failed message. Once you finally get in, it's easy to submit your check in.",2
valerie salas,It's signs out a lot,1
c r,"Third trip since Aug. 9 and today I could not find the Peace Arch or Blaine truck crossings on the port of entry list. It took some digging to find that on the Canadian side Peace Arch is called ""Douglas."" I believe the last time I set up a trip, I was able to type in both Blaine and Peace Arch to find the crossing I wanted. Since other crossings show alternate U.S. names, adding Peace Arch name back in the app would be helpful please I had never heard it called Douglas before today. I don't know anyone, US or Canadian, who call it anything other than Peace Arch.",3
Alison S,What is the purpose of this? I am told I need to download the app to get back into Canada after travel outside the country. I am unable to submit any information it keeps asking me to connect to the internet. I am clearly connected. Fix it so I can go home next week.,1
DA Braverman,The App is pretty straight forward. Easy to figure out. Something to be said about functional simplicity...,5
Revati Pujari,I am fully vaccinated and also have within 72 hours covid 19 negative test result. The immigration officer did not tell me to quarantine but the app is still sending me notifications to check in daily.,1
Dragan Karagic,Fast and easy,5
Anza Khan,"Was this app programmed by an unpaid intern? You cannot change the time format from am to pm without going back several times, also, your clock widget is terrible it gets stuck at times after the half hour mark. If I enter a time in PM is sets it to 0. Its like there is no concept of properly storing state of a component here, also you hardcode default values for no reason. Terrible software engineering at display here. I wish I could give this a 0.",1
Alison Masters,"Stressful. Govt website says 'you must use Arrivecan up to 72 hours before your travel to enter your vaccination status' etc. Step 2 of 12 of the form says 'if your trip is not within the next 72 hours, come back later' and blocks you from adding the rest of the information officially required in advance of the 72 hours from your travel time. Kafkaesque.",1
Alan Toney,Fairly straightforward. wish I could have uploaded my information prior to 72 hours.,4
Paul Dowden,Easy enough to navigate though access to a smart phone or computer is a necessity,5
Audrey Hartono,"Confused!!! After arrival, I sign it to the app, and it's starting over from the beginning as if I have never submit one before. Like I have not arrive yet. Other family members travelling with me, received notifications.",1

Hearty Prince,user friendly,5
Ahmed Jama,every thing works well amazing.,5
Nicholas Ronyai,smooth experience,5
James Magarian,Worthless,1
Rene Rodriguez,The app would not allow me to upload my 2 pictures of my covid vaccine. Which then lead to a confusion about receiving emails and calls for daily check ins. I had a negative PCR arriving into Canada and was not asked to quarentine WHY so much confusion? I called a 1888 # to clarify and all they could say was to ignore the calls and ignore the messages. I wanted to go back to the app and upload my vaccines photos and would not let me. The I get messages about doing a test after 8 days. 0 stars,1

Seriously? then e-mail, then phone. how can you release such programs where there are constant failures ... I don't understand where the rating is high enough, when so many people are complaining",1

Margaret Colvin,I had a problem scanning the passport page and finally entered the info manually.,4
A Google user,would be nice to be able to navigate through entries and not have to go through all the entries all the time.,3
Mahesh Parab,Application doesnt record the exemptions given by the border agents to the fully vaccinated travelers with negative test at the port of entry. The daily reminders in tandem with email and automated phone calls to exempt travelers is confusing. This Silo working of the the application doesn't provide seamless experience to the travelers and fails the purpose the application is supposed to serve.,1
Rob Bowns,"Your latest update forces the pdf information links (exempt travel) from the gov't website to be opened only by the app, and cannot be zoomed or saved. (android)",1

Karenys Cuicas,Great,5
Aurélien Demont,Working without any problem.,5
D.K,"UX is great, stability - not so much. The app is minimal, so it's surprising that it fails so frequently. Several times during my quarantine the app would fail to process my data : I get signed in, answer the question then get a pop up ""SignIn failed"" and the app reverts to the screen where you have to enter your arrival info. If I restart the app - same story. The only ""solution"" is to re-install the app and submit again or call-in. The next morning the app may or may not work again",3

Thankfully I'm polite and have a very technical background. Thank God I'm a Canadian citizen by birth. I consider being forced to use particular technology cruel and oppressive. I should be able to use my device with the software and admin access I wish to. Surely I'm compedent.",1
Andy Ying,passport scanning isn't good,3
Scott Ashton,over informs with useless information. under informs on important information. not clear enough for its purpose. the purpose is important and necessary. unfortunately the airlines are acting as border protection and not leaving the job for the professionals. the app itself is easy enough to use. integrates with camera and easy to put in documentation.,3

Steve Benitah,Cannot view receipt offline What is the point of this if I cannot show the receipt at the customs without internet? Why isn't it stored in the app if it was done an hour prior?. I had to shuffle around at the customs to get an internet connection from the airport just to show the receipt number.,1
K D,The app is not yet updated for foreign travelers entering (on or after Sept. 7th) Canada. Only US resident can be chosen.,3

L Va,"Good for imputing your travel info, but constantly signs you out and gives you the ""not connected to the internet"" error, no matter your Internet connection (I tried both mobile data and my home internet). When trying to sign in again, you have to attempt multiple times before being admitted. There is a chance that the app shows the previous day's completed check-in, so you have to restart until it shows the current date. In my experience, I have been signed out of my account more after day 8.",2

Christina Schultz,Stupid app that I have to have but thinks I should quarantine even though I'm exempt? Just deleted and ignoring further messages. I was cleared by Border services for having a recent Negative PCR and double vaccine. I think this is meant for non-exempt traveller's that need to quarantine. Just show your code and delete the app if you're exempt.,1
Summa Laude,Why does it ask for quarantine location for exempt travellers,1
Milan Patel,User friendly interface,5
Ilia Tchistiline,Posting this review a second time because somehow my first review was removed! I arrived in Canada on August 29the but the app says it was on August 30the despite my original arrival being confirmed by border security and staff administering covid test (and have plane ticket to prove it)! Why was my original review removed and who can fix this wrong date issue?,1

PCR tests must be submitted to the lab within 71h59m of scheduled departure. My test was 74 hours ahead of my flight and we were refused. There is NO grace period going into Canada and ""ArriveCan"" could have alerted me beforehand, IF they pre-approved the results. Really disappointing.",1

Max Mastalerz,Why would you ask me every single day if I have symptoms when I just got a negative test result and am in quarantine. Why not just assume I have no symptoms to start and then ask me to log in and report them if I actually develop symptoms later. Waste of time.

james ecker,This app gets me all the way to declaring which countries I've visited in the last 14 days and won't show the full screen to select. Can't scroll up or down. Closed. Opened. Nada. Android app for Android phone. You can tell it's a government app. I had to scramble to add everything online at the airport. It's a complete pita...,1
K. Mark,"The app is slick and fast, but the process has too many hoops to jump through.",5
nizam uddin,no place for arriving international cabin crew.,1

Shanil Patel,super easy and simple app to use,5
Anke Berkefeld,information which you have prior to the PCR test result should be able to be entered earlier,1
Ekeegwa Farm,Consumes alot of bandwidth and space. Not good,1
A K,The downloading of the app is a requirement by the Government of Canada so no choice. But the app is useless as it does not recognize if you don't have to quarantine because you meet all the requirements. It automatically assumes you have to quarantine so everyday for 14 days you get push notification through the app after your arrival requesting quarantine update. If you making an app then make it so that it is efficient not just put together for the sake of it!!!,1
Stephen Trombley,This app failed to allow me to fly home it kept me prisoner in the United States because it wouldn't let me fill out the rest of the form in resulting in not receiving or allowing me to download my boarding pass and I got refused air travel which caused my covid papers to expire down in the states thank you very much. If this is a government app they do everything to take your rights away.,1
Todd Roberts,Takes a while but straight forward.,5
Michael Dearry,easy to use and makes me feel safer!,5
Dagmar Gagea,"Everything worked fine until my day 9. For some reason today I opened the app and I needed to sign în again wich is not working. I reseted my password ,uninstaled the app and installed it again. Still not working. It says that the password and email are not correct. But they are because I entered them in my browser and they worked.",3
Laura B.,"What a great app! I was concerned about what a nightmare it would be, but it is actually the opposite. Runs smoothly, everything is very well laid out and super user friendly. There are a lot of questions, but you can do a section at a time and all your info is saved until you finalize it. It sure saves time for both the officer and the traveller at the border crossing! Thank you!",5
Livon Lord,"Unfortunately, it fails to recognize my email and password more than half of the time (it's written down digitally and physically, so I know I didn't forget). Considering how seriously I'm expected to take the daily reporting and how steep the fines are, having this be a hindrance is quite problematic. I'm actively trying to follow all safety protocols; I'd rather any failures be due to my negligence rather than something out of my control. For the latter I can not accept responsibility.",2
Danyell Corley Salters,"This is a lengthy but necessary process to have in place. Just make sure you have an address to quarantine in if it's necessary. Also, you can fill this form out for everyone in your group.",4
Zulqernain Malik,poor UI and UX. but that's because the govt takes charge,2
Declan Hayes-McCoy,"Relatively self explanatory and easy to use, but it does have some areas where it is worryingly inconsistent! One page asked for a negative Covid test taken 72hrs before arrival in Canada, and the very next page asked for the same test, but 72hrs before departure for Canada. Very different things when you are trying to manage booking a Covid test, and getting the result in a very tight timeframe!",3
Mark Lake,ArriveCAN have given me no support in signing in at a loss of what to do,1
Mayra Rodriguez Valladares,It was easy until about 4 questions before the end. The app kept freezing.,2
Minas Tachjian,What an affront to freedom. I am ashamed to call myself Canadian.,1

Alice Kwan,"Got stuck up to Travel history. Tried to uninstall and reinstall, complete the form again, still stuck.",1
Jeanette Birch,"Really good app, there are some minor flaws in terms of UX but none that their amazing customer service team can't help you with. Am really, really impressed.",5
Fogo Labs,Impossible to find the land port of entry unless you know the exact name. Even Google Maps doesn't know the exact name of the Hill Island crossing. Spent a frustrating hour on the phone trying to figure it out. The app should be more intuitive.,2
Fi Gi,Complete garbage,1
Abba Hasan,Easy to fill comprehensive form,4
Emma Neto,Impressively streamlined. Hopefully it works just as smoothly in the airports!,5
Larry Lewack,"Clear, easy to use.",5
Kh A,"A useless and worthless app,full of repeating stuff, meaningless Items , irrelevant subjects, questions with obvious answers and list goes on, I filled it up without knowing that should I be quarantined or set free at the end, if one have papers showing full vaccinations and negative covid test why do they need to go through this nonsense",1
Bernard yu,Pretty good man,4
Arwen Rosenbaum,Pretty straightforward. Be sure to have your passport and vaccine card handy!,5
Ira Abel,"a bit complicated, and the scanner is pretty bad, but it's easy enough to enter the information manually.",5
Lady lexely Bangayan,I cannot use it now. I cannot check in and I do not receive the daily emails anymore.,3
Jimmy Nguyen,"I understand why the app is needed, however it has been absolutely frustrating to use. I will constantly get errors saying my username and password is incorrect, and once I do manage to get past the login screen, I find that the check-in is not available. Instead I see a screen asking me to fill out a new form, which to be quite frank stresses me out since I was given so many warnings on what would happen if I don't follow through the quarantine process properly.",1
Edwardolardo Plays,Overall it was quite seamless and easy to understand. Everything was working and there were no problems going into the airport. The only complaint is that we can't fill it in earlier than 3 days or a week. I guess it's because one of the questions asked if we had a negative pre-travel 72-hour PCR test.,4
Sparkfest Queen,"Screen froze midway thru app...Tried 4 times on Android, had to delete and restart on PC.",2
ian j. Spann,The app was very easy to fill out.,5

Juan López,extremely easy to use. only thing to know is re-check information when scanning passports as some numbers might incorrectly be identified as letters,5
Օsko. Giragosian,Very Good,5
Alexis M,"My grandmother is trying to use this app for her visit to see family here, she's 75 and she's had nothing but troubles using this app. Tells her she's got the wrong password even though she doesn't and I helped her with resetting. It doesn't always save all the information she enters and acts as if she never entered any of the information what so ever at other times. It also keeps telling her the date isn't valid when its withing her 72hr mark from time of completing covid tests.",1

Mark Rudge,"Utterly useless app. Just try to enter an arrival time. 7:11 am is all you'll get. PM!!!!! Never!!!!! I used it once before Covid and entering all the info again in the kiosk anyhow. Good God, can the government not do anything right the first time?",1
Doug Cronk,"Can download app but not upload vaccination proof documents here is your response - CBSA-ASFCAugust 23, 2021 If you select yes to the question ‘is your travel related to any of the following purposes: cross-border work, essential services, medical support, or trade or transport’, you cannot upload proof of vaccination in ArriveCAN.

Richard Choy,"The ArriveCAN app was simple to fill out, although it took some time to complete, for two of us returning to Canada together. But at the end, I could not complete the submission, with the app saying that the submission time is not valid and asking if I want to update the arrival time. I could not understand the issue since it was within the 72-hour window. Fortunately my wife completed the ArriveCAN on her phone with the identical information (we did it together) and she got a receipt.",1

Kaitlyn Watts,"Completely useless app other than the initial receipt given and used at the border. Apparently you're supposed to be able to do your daily and required check ins on the app but this feature was not available to me. I tried reinstalling the app, making sure it was up to date but nothing worked. I reached out on their online get help page with my issue and was replied to with a cut and paste email which directed me to reach out via the get help page which is what I did in the first place.",1
Sarah O'Connor,I'm a Canadian resident but when I try to fill out the form and it asks for country of original departure it won't accept Canada as an answer. Otherwise a good app to have during the pandemic but not clear for how Canadians use it.,2

Cyrus Haghighi,"Very buggy, I keep getting the 400 error that I have no internet to submit, even though my internet works fine and used different wifi and data to test it ( no issues with permissions either).

Noah R,"Canada should be able to do this automatically. I'm not experiencing any problems, the app itself works fine. But after taking fifteen minutes to do my paperwork on it, the border patrol agents didn't even ask for ArriveCAN. I had to pull out my vaccine and covid test paperwork all over again on arrival because apparently the sticker departures put on my passport - after not looking at ArriveCAN - wasn't what the arrivals agents were looking for. Needless triplication of efforts, and to think taxpayers spent all that money on developing this app that isn't even being used!",1
Deema Nuseir,Great app. Really easy to use. Very helpful that the information you've already entered stays saved and you can finish filling in the form at a later time.,5

C Garza,Dysfunctional.,1
Robin Fenner-Baker,the app was so easy to use!!,5
Todd Frutchey,Updated review from 1 star review. Had an error on their end for several hours that seriously threatened my ability to travel. When it works it seems to work without much trouble. But the grief it gave me earlier is unforgivable given it's essential for travel into Canada. These draconian measures are inconvenient enough absent service failures that span several hours.,3
Royce Wright Jr,easy! especially for a govt run initiative.,5
Tyler Sabo,"Works well now after service outage. Clear, concise and gets the job done.",5

Willie Gruber,"Worst app ever. just before the end, after inputting all data it asks for other countries visited BUT THAT SCREEN WON'T SCROLL. WHAT A PIECE OF GARBAGE THIS APP IS!!! You can't answer the question, you can't advance. To get around it, you have to shrink your phone font size even if you are sight challenged. So this app discriminates against the sight impaired and their is nowhere to get help. If you change platforms you must start over. This app is breathtakingly brutally bad.",1
Danielle Breton,Very simple and easy to use/navigate. Very clear instructions and questions.,5
Susan Duvall,The App will not work properly and there are no codes sent to email address .Vary up set with the App.,1

Jesenka Bilic,"I can't submit my questionnaire because I'm getting the message that the date of arrival is more than 72 hours away, which it's not. Why am I getting this message?

Faycal Guermaz,complicated,1
Daniel Kuang,"App doesn't use the time zone at the arrival city in its calculations... Because my time zone is a couple of hours behind the city where I'm arriving at, the app thought I was outside the 72 hour window. How was this not caught in testing? You are aware that people TRAVELING may come from other time zones, yes?",2
Rohit Gopal,"The app is pretty useful from the standpoint of being able to enter Canada again, but I've had multiple issues where my vaccination card photos will upload, but the border patrol will say they don't have them on file. This happened to me twice, forcing me to turn around back to the USA border until they just looked at my physical card instead. This app also doesn't seem to get updated in line with Canada's rule changes. When requirements change, the app still sends daily reminders for old procedures. It's better than I expected for a government app, but overall a very mediocre experience.",2
Kian Houman,simple and quick if you have all documents near you (20 mins max),5

Michael Turner,"Returned home only to have the customs agent not look at it. You are then supposed to self report for 14 days. I've been back 3 days and was only able to do so once. Now the app has rebooted and wants me to enter my return flight information again even though I'm already home. The relevance of this app is questionable as you still physically need all your documents such as vaccine card, negative COVID test, etc, so not sure what purpose this serves other than to track you, which it does poorly.",1
Becca Cannon,I'm on day 6 and the app completely erased my information. I'm not sure what to do.,1
Mo Shelly,I can't submit ..it said no internet connexion..I travel tomorrow..what I have to do??,1
Patty Chan,"The app is unable to submit the information. It hangs up at 79% submission then the error comes up asking me to resubmit. I resubmitted at least 10 times, then uninstalled and reinstalled the app, reentered all of the information again, and the same problem happens again. The error code is 5-503",1
Jeremy Hughes,"I just downloaded the app this morning and filled out everything, when I tried to submit at the end it says submission failed with an error code of 5-503",1
Kevin Hoffpauer,easy to use.,5
Mustafa Kirgul,"I was not able to set our arrival time correctly. It kept reverting back to an arbitrary time of ""03:01 am""",4
Stan Wolanski,"Given time to find documents. Can return later. Flop 1 - a sent vaccination pdf shows only as icon, you can't see it to ensure you sent the right pdf. Better to use camera. Flop 2 - you can't review after you have the ""receipt "", you only get the receipt code.",3
Przemek Marcinkiewicz,Useless,1
Kenny Strong,Doesn't recognize valid addresses,1
Ryan Anastasio,have to get tested within 72 hours of visit but it takes up to 5 days to get results. someone didn't think this through.....,3
ROGER,"Why can't I upload my vaccine records now, instead of only 3 days prior to arrival",1
Muniza Zaman,I have been unable to login into the app for a day now to resubmit a new form but I cannot sign in again even after I reinstalled the app.,1
Mary Oshei,It won't finish downloading. Been trying for about an hour.,1
Adam Hemzal,"I was travelling with my friend and we filled the form twice - once at my arriveCAN and second at her arriveCAN. At the borders we showed only her receipt but she didnt get any notifications for 5 days! On the other hand, my ArriveCAN shows me dail check-ins and I didn't show my receipt to a Canadian officer. The app and the whole system is a total chaos. I cannot even call on the number as my plan does not allow calls to Canada.. I am totally upset and angry and don't recommend the app.",1
James Miller,easy to understand and use,5

Matthew Barcellos,easy to follow,5
Saad Lahkim,This is a great application and Greta job for the government of Canada,5
swastik upadhyay,Good,5
Tony Fowler,"Seems to work fine until you get to the question about quarantining. Theres the choice to just return home instead of crossing, but it requires you to enter a destination address no matter what option you choose. The problem is this step requires you to enter a 'Canadian' address, so if you don't live in Canada, there doesnt appear to be a workaround for this step. I'm literally stuck on this step using either the app or website. Very frustrating and Im running out of time.",4
K Dobermann,Infringement of privacy. Against constitutional charter rights. Authoritarian app designed to track and monitor it's people.,1
Keanu Henry,Easy to fill out and quick,5
Nat Cohen,very easy to use,5
Kye Lippold,very efficient!,5
Michael Jones,Not designed for actual date entry in several places. crashed 4 times while trying to upload proof of vaccination.,2
Abhinav Rathee,very good app,4
Lori Caldwell,"If I can complete this, anyone can!",5
Peter Turchyn,Does not allow one to view the documents you uploaded. We are fully vaccinated and passed our PCR test on arrival and dont have to quarantine and yet the stupid app keeps telling us that we have to take the test at 9 days. How did this defective app ever pass QA?,1
Donna Mcvay,Seems there is a glitch with android. I rebooted ..un installed ..reinstalled. restarted phone and likeva previous review could not get past the travel page. Could not scroll down. Stuck at the border for an hr trying over and over. Finally had to use an other travellers app on an Iphone.. added to their document. Please fix that. My phone is a brand new samsung fe 20 not old running system please fix this.,3
Noam Elituv,super easy and accommodating,5
Jashan Preet,Great App Ever 👍,5
HERMES,"App has bugs. Passport barcode reader mispelt names, and unable to select pm landing time on analogue or digital clock.",1
Sampada Bodkhe,My arriveCan app does not give me notifications to enter symptoms everyday. Do I need to call the health Canada number in this case? Why does my app not work though ?,1
Ashley C,I try to log in and it keeps saying my password is wrong despite being 100 percent sure that's not the case but every single attempt doesn't work. Even changing my password and then trying to log in doesn't work. Like I have no idea how I'm supposed to put my information in if I can't get into the app to begin with. Giving me a lot of anxiety this app.,1
Dr. Farhad Gh,It doesn't let me submit! Keeps giving the same error:PQ-400. Very frustrating,1
Deepu Muraleedharan,Very useful & informative app.,5
Kendra Black,"When I read the comments, prior to travel, I expected a nightmare when using the app. What a pleasant surprise to finally use it -- it's very easy to navigate, edit, and submit. The Save and Close feature on each page is appreciated for those who need to edit, and it would be great if one could then go directly to where they left off rather than manually skipping through each page they'd previously interacted with.",4
Victor,Easy and clear steps to complete questions,5
Mike R,Fine but long.,4
Timofey Asyrkin,"Easy to use app, no problems or glitches",5
Dave Wright,"Canada is an absolute dumpster fire and this app sums it up. covid 18 months in and this is the worst app ever, like that tracing app that didn't work because 99% of ppl have had contact with the virus and a lot that do have no idea they did because they aren't 98 yrs old or rife with comorbidities. absolute joke.",1
Lexx Lazerman,very straightforward,5
Victot Haddad,I love to visit Canada all the time,5
Jeff Jirka,not user friendly,1
Jacalyn Hodgson,"In addition to having issues with data submission on multiple android devices, the app is sending me requests for quarantine updates despite the fact that I am exempt, as confirmed by CBSA, fully vaccinated, and have had 3 negative covid tests in the last week. None others in my party are seeing these notifications so that is very strange",1
Adam Kettle,"Verification code wouldn't work after multiple resends on two different phones and accounts, completely prevented us from crossing and being able to see family",1
James,It's nice to have this ArriveCAN because it decreases the waiting time at the airport if all information is being entered manually at the airport. This also minimizes the in-person interaction.,5
Dawn Craig,It was very easy and user friendly.,5
Fernando García de la Serrana,easy an fast to use,5
Nichola Taylor,"You need to update this for those of us who are fully vaccinated. To be asked if we took the day 8 test repeatedly after day 8 is just silliness. All the information is on ArriveCan with our vaccination certificates, surely there is away to adjust this for those who are exempt. Or at least change the wording to if you are exempt ignore or say no. I think this needs to be updated to suit all scenarios rather than just those who are not vaccinated.",3
Ian Kyle,This was very easy to use. We have little ones and the website had answers to all our questions. Thank you Canada for making this very functional app. We are excited to return to Canada.,5

Heinz Plaumann,Sat on pending for hours and hours...and hours.,1
ROB KILMER,This app is totally useless. It always freezes up near the end.,1
Sele L,Are you kidding?!?! We need to book a quarantine place for 14 days before we visit Canada for less than one day even we meet all the requirements to have negative covid-19 test within 72 hours and fully vaccinated. That is a very ridiculous requirement for short term visit.,1
Donald Tarr,"Easy, Great App.. just have some patience filling it out..",4
Susan R,Terrible,1
oY oY,Just check for RTPCR negative and allow. Vaccine distribution is inequitable and ArriveCAN is RIDICULOUS dogshit,1
Roborta Atkinson,Easy to use. Passport upload works great.,5
Cindy M,"very unfriendly and stupid. we plan on just seeing niagara falls from Canada side..maybe 1 hr.and returning to USA. and they ask quanratine lodging?? well...if u deny us entry at border, mutual loss. loss of scenery for us, loss of revenue for Canada.",1
Claudia MNWard,WAAAAAAAAY TOO MUCH TIME TO FILL IT!!!,3
David Turnbow,"the border official, top notch!",5
Keegan MacLeod,It's pretty fine for a government app. Functions pretty okay.,3
Abhijeet Singh,App is well designed and does its job effexrively. Friendly interface with no bugs in UI abd overall usage experience,5
Sam Katz,I used this app two weeks ago when I returned to Canada from the US. It stopped working. Two different CBSA agents tried to make it work but couldn't. Finally ended up filling out the paper form. What a waste of time and resources.,1

Rick Woods,I can't scroll down to an answer for the question about travel history. It's so frustrating that you have to go through this whole process then you can't even finish so that you can use it.,2
Pritha Mukherji,I'm landing on 16th August at 3:25p.m. but it's not allowing me to proceed. Please sort this out urgently.,1
Keith Almeter,very easy to do,5

Gary Mello,"as long as you have all your documents ready, it's easy. about 10-15 mins to complete.",5
Ellen Arteca,"Great, easy to use",5
Alexi Turcotte,Painless process. Great app.,5
Keith Veerman,"the initial screen is very confusing, with 5 choices but no explanation as to how to choose the right one. Once you're on track the form completion is straightforward. you can save and close to return to the app, if you need to come back later. The final border entry document is readily accessible when you re-enter the app.",4
Rahul Dhar,The app worked smoothly. All options were clear and explained well.,4
Wissam Wehbe,"Very stupid application, but obligatory",1
AAinTX,need to be able to complete parts as you go. Having to do all of this right before the flight for a family takes far too much time and many pieces could have been done ahead,1
Pierfrancesco Bripi,You are an awesome country,5
Rick F,"Pretty straight forward but a bit confusing because app not up to date with latest Easing of Border Measures sent out 3 July 2021. Yes, ver 2.20.9 installed. Issue is app still requesting quarantine plan and details when no longer required for travel to Canada for citizens.",4
anita obleness,Thanks for the quick response. Appreciate it.,4
Allan David Dias Domingos,Easy app to use.,5
David Eaton,"really really solid and efficient app, very good as far as govt-created software goes, by a mile (kilometre?)",5
Chris Carlea,Easy to use,5

Alan Pawlowski,"collects info smoothly, but still asks quarantine questions even after proof of vaccination is uploaded.",3
Julius Vedasto,Easy enough to use.,5
So,the arriveCan app is superb and friendly. There's been a lot of improvements to the app.,5
S Sangha,Dumb App like the Canadian Government,1
Luke Reynolds,This app was easy to use given the level of scrutiny required for border security.,5
Keneddy Beato,Very cool,5
Shelly Jumbu,Easy to use and navigate,5
Michael Schwern,Clear instructions. Peace of mind.,5
Riny van Someren,"poor instructions, unforgiving. Would not accept the verification code sent to me. There is apparently no ""UPDATE"" function. You have to delete your existing app and then download the new version. ""Troubleshoot"" is absolutely useless. I worry that I will not be able to use this app when required. Finally, the ""Upload"" button takes you to a page of confusing information but does not actually allow you to upload anything. Frustrating",2

Mohammadreza Osouli,"3 days of hotel quarantine is removed from rules from August 9th, but it's still in the survey. I believe that it needs update.",5
Richard Secours,Seriously flawed. Can't even finish a submission.,1
Rachael Stark,"The requirement is to fill this out 72 hours before travel. It asks if you have a negative covid screen within less than 72 hours. There aren't any questions about if you have plans to get the screen, only if you currently have it. It doesn't have any options for length of travel. we are going for 2 days. if you tell us we have to quarantine for 14, we won't cross. But there is no way to enter this information.",1
DragonRaven Schwarz,typing is rough very sensitive and adds letters on you .,3
Arbaaz Durrani,"Dear developer, please add back buttons on every form or pop-ups (when I'm selecting 'DATE OF ARRIVAL' next button, it takes me on time screen and I couldn't able to change date again) there should be a back button.",4
Rhea Averyl Tan,Wonderful and detailed app!,5
John Connick,After you work a 12 hour shift who wants to mess with an apt that tells you your password is wrong 3 or 4 times scanning passport manny manny times is a test of one's patients and then repeated it to a customs officer no need for the apt,1
Bruce Owen,Can't go back and edit a time change or other item after submission. Have to retype everything every time.,2
Tricia Shannon,easy to use... but no facility to upload electronic covid passport.,5
Daiwat Natu,I check in everyday and don't receive any information or notification for daily check-in. Please help and sort this out.,4
Jason Kim,so complicated and where should I find the info to reserve the arrival test??? they should do better than this if they want people to follow the rules,1
Dennis Peterson,it won't let me sign in. double and triple checked e mail and password. still does not work. also computer is on line and so is cellphone.,1
Wendy Yang,The process is quite clear.,5
Stan Volosatov,"Can not report daily symptoms, there is just O such option in the app, so when I use phone line I basically can not trust that my info has been collected and checked for my arrival. If you make it easy for Canadian travelers to make their trips at least make an app that works and causes minimal frustration.",2
A Google user,"After arriving Canada, the information I have written was lost. So, we cannot complete the daily check on this app",1
Linda Knoke,easy process,5
Samantha Zara,I keep being asked if I took a day 8 test even though I've been exempt from taking one. This is followed up by threatening calls and emails. I've tried to clear this up by calling arrive can but the calls and emails continue.,1
Svetlozar Rusev,"If you don't install the app you don't have to quarantine assuming that you are fully vaccinated and tested. Installing the app places you under quarantine regardless of full compliance. The 8-th day testing request persistence is exhaustingly confusing especially in the clarification. At day 11, I am still being asked about 8-th day test. Answering NO means that I tested positive according to the application which is false in my case. I have not been given a self-test kit upon arrival. Would you please at least give options reflecting other than the suggested possibilities.",1
Martin Bussieres,very self explanatory,5
William Wild,Easy to use,5

Jeanette Newman,Very easy to navigate,5
Dario Macedo,I can't set my arriving time in the app is having a bug please fix it.,3

Paul Zucati,super handy dandy and convenient,5
Calin Ionescu,very good. thank you,5
dan goheen,I'd rather not use it,1
Wayne,Does not account for a one day visit across the border from a US citizen. Why would I have a 14 quarantine plan for a one day visit if I test negative AND fully vaccinated? It's antithetical to the whole border opening.,1
Jackie David-Yost,Several times I've reset my password n message still says it failed .I requested a reset password n Im not receiving the email.Please resend,1
Philip Hulme,"If you are traveling from the US to Canada, you are required to use this app. Unfortunately, it is nowhere as intelligently designed as VeriFLY, the 3rd party app required by the airline when departing Canada. ArriveCAN has no feature to upload your COVID test for independent verification, so airline personnel and Canadian Immigration officers are required to squint at a photo on your phone or a sheet of paper to see the test date and results. Furthermore, there is no prompting or integration with airport on-site labs to pre-register for the required swab COVID test (administered by LifeLabs in BC). Basically, ArriveCAN is best at sending annoying symptom question messages for 14 days. If we want to speed up border crossings, Transport Canada needs to improve this app.",2
Kay Warner,It doesn't load!,1
Amrik Singh Deol,Easy to use. Really good at retaining information when using the app. Great Job 👍🏼,5

Gab Rey,"Fully vaccinated and tested negative on arrival at the airport and I still get these notifications. The answer: Ignore them. It doesn't make sense. Just stop sending the notifications, very confusing. The system does not allow to verify the registered information.

Paul H,Downloaded in mid July 2021. Very simple and easy to use.,5
Mihaela,"It is too general and doesn't apply to the individual requirements. We have to report symptoms for an unvaccinated child under 4 so no day 8 test required for the child. However, after day 8, you don't have a N/A option for the test, it's either yes or no and you cannot by-pass the test question to report symptoms. Otherwise not bad but it needs more work to customize for various situations.",3
John Bujold,Works for me,4
Waqar Khan,Good,4
Gege H,I had no issues with the app. Works fine and very easy to use. I'm in Canada now and still in my 14 day quarantine. I get the daily check in notifications.,5
:D Usher,"We were exempt from the day 8 covid test but we could only answer yes or no if completed. I didn't know how to answer so I left it blank. The next day the app told me I then have to quarantine. The app doesn't have to be completed for fully vaccinated, so that should be an option. Also an option for people who have to travel long distances from the main airports for entry. For the first day you might be in your arrival city, but then you have to drive to your home.",3

Christine Gaeta,Easy to complete.,5
Douglas Alves,too short a time for the receipt countdown,4
Jo P,The app isn't updated to reflect changes in government rules regarding vaccinated and testing requirements. app asks for Day 8 testing when not all parties are required to submit day 8 tests and the design of question doesn't allow for respondents to state exemptions are in place.,2

Rick Housworth,"Waited on hold with arrivecan app. help center for 48:37min. Told to delete app and redo! 4 times later still locks up on travel history screen! Used phone and tower computer. Have shot, test and arrivecan app. Fails. No answer. Fun times.",1

Jl Witt,difficult to add quebec proof of vaccination,2
david sandor,"its clunky, too easy to scan through questions and accidentally click on the wrong answer, and it does not provide any explanation as to what the symbols and colors mean as associated with your name when completed, other than a vague ""see a border guard upon arrival"" , associated with a ""v"". This makes u wonder "" why? whats wrong w my vaccines."".",1
Angela Knight,"Easy to fill out, save information if you cannot fill it all out right away",5
Vesselina Konstantinova,why do I need to start from the beginning every time I close the app considering I've pressed save and close?,1
Thessalonika T Benny,"Too cumbersome! One photo is enough! Also, I wanted to submit in advance, but cannot even start the form for August 12. Not user friendly for walking or driving across. Dear Tech team - I was not asking for a technical solution to the timing issue - that is for the original designer. It should not have been designed for only 3 days ahead. You did as you were told, but they should have had an option to complete the form for updates when travel was closer. Your program is still combersome! But probably not the tech teams' fault.",1
Elena Gonchar,"This app doesn't work on Android, iPhones only. I tried so many times to install reinstall restart my phone and nothing. Then I tried it from my sister's iPhone and it worked right away. Make a version that will work for androids too!",1

Brendan Cullis,How come I cannot enter my proof of vaccination under the exemption section?,1
Joe Quinn,AP WILL NOT DOWNLOAD,1

I would love to get things started earlier and make sure I have what I need well before my arrival date. Reading other reviews.

Maria Clara Perez Duran,Excelente and easy app,5
nisha samin,"Doesn't let me go beyond a few questions. I hv installed uninstalled etc etc as a result did not have it ready when I checked in. It's rubbish. They need to get their act on order if it's mandatory. The airport officer manually inputed info and now as a result of their glitch I have to call the reporting line daily. Ridiculous, poorly managed.",1
yellowwducky,A lot of steps but works well,5
Morgan Rae,"I have been called on the phone multiple times every day to complete check in, 16 times just this morning, despite submitting the check in as soon as it opens on the app. I am exhausted of answering phone calls from the government and don't understand how the app can fail so badly at storing information.

GURINDER KALSI,easy and time saving,5
Magda B.,"This app does not allow to enter info in advance. I want to upload flight, vaccine and passport info in advance since I will not have internet/data in the country I will visit and I am not allowed. Flight date only a couple of days in advance. There is no way to exit date calendar with no selection in the next 3 days (even if I want to select a date in August or Cancel. Also there is no way to see if I have the latest version. I installed app a while back and I see last update is July 12, 2021",2
Moody Me,"I'm currently abroad, planning to return to Canada. This app doesn't provide any information on what I need to do or to have prior to my trip, it just sends me to a COMPLETELY OUTDATED page on the Canadian govt's website that still talks about ""the 14 day quarantine period for travelers without COVID 19 symptoms"", it's ridiculous! I need to know exactly what the latest requirements are before I even book my flight back, these requirements keep changing & it's impossible to find the latest info!",1
Ryan Bravo,"It is my first time to create an account but already it says ""An account already exists for the email address provided""? I did Uninstalled and intalled but same thing happened helep please!",1
Cosimo Cotroneo,IT DOESN'T EXCEPT THE PASSWORD.,1
Asimpleguy,very easy to use for anyone. a small complaint of mine would be a number or site that shows places to get covid testing (free and not free). mine was for free because I found no parts on this site that states I have to pay for my test prior to returning to Canada,5
benzo543,This app has SO MANY BUGS. I can't change the hour my flight arrives and the calendar is stuck on the current month.,1
ghulam muhammad,Excelent,5
Gerry Whittaker,"I want to preload my documents before leaving Canada but can't. This ap seems to be pretty useless, because I want to know that my documents are all entered correctly and there aren't any problems before I leave. I also have to re-enter everything each time I travel.",1
Liz McTaggart,I get to question 14 on both app and online and I can not proceed. very frustrating. what to do??,1
Ahmad Ijad,At the end no body tells you it is over. No congrads no nothing. Im just gonna uninstall the app. I obeyed this thing for 14 days and now no mssg received saying hey good job and u can go out now. Quarantine is over. No. Nothing received. No permission to get out of your house. You are alone in this. They dont care any more.,3
Paddy Arunachalam,was pretty much useless. all systems were down and we had to manually do the whole thing. terrible waste,1
Moazzam Khan,Ao far looks good,5
Michael Watson,"it's only for people that are arriving to Canada, is there a app for people in Canada where you put information in that states you are fully vaccinated and are safe to travel",1
R Toronto,Having everything ready before starting the process made the upload and return to Canada very easy. My issue is post arrival: though cleared by CBSA that I did not have to quarantine plus getting the PCR test at the airport upon arrival (negative) the app is still treating me as if I am under full quarantine! I am getting multiple notifications to check in daily and do the self test on day 8: opposite of what the website states.,4

Chris Scharenbroich,Can't get a verification code to activate my account. Says try again later... Guidance text for password is not readable for red green color blind individuals. Canada has a huge tourism industry and unfortunatly apps like this don't help to get them back in business...,1

Venkatesh V,easy and User friendly,5
J. Cameron,"For being the one tool to notify the government of Canada that I'm not worthy of being fined $1,000,000 in quarantine, this thing sure is glitchy. I usually have to try 3-5 times to sign in in different attempts of closing and reopening the app before it lets me tell the gov that, ""yes, I don't have symptoms"". Sometimes I'll get an urgent email or phone call reminding me to fill out the app, and the thing will just block me from signing in or tell me to come back later. Typical of our gov.",2
Nishi B,"Keeps saying sign in failed even if it's correct or while I'm already in my account and filling out the daily quarantine report, it'll say sign in fail after I submit the report.",3

ELLIOT Jacobs,"I have filled out everything when I get to submit page it spins around and either stops at 16% or goes as far as 70% then stops and says Submission failed and I should check my internet connection, which is working perfectly.

Aer Ehm,Bullshirt tracking app ! I dispise being forcedf to use this and I hope the creater and everyone who pushed it dies painfully.,1
Denine S,No where to enter email address on page where it asks for phone number and email address,2
Matthew Archambault,"Only works for 14 day trips !!! I travel from the US to Canada once, if not twice a week. ArriveCAN only allows me to fill out 14 day trips, that cannot be cancelled or restarted. The border guards affirm me that I MUST fill out and upload my vaccine card to ArriveCAN every single time I cross, or else I must quarantine for 14 days. And yet it is impossible for me to fill out ArriveCAN everytime I cross. This a huge hole in the app that needs to be attended to!!",1
jack h.,Terrible. App won't download.,1
Mohsin Raza Qureshi,Excellent,5
Mark Green,Everyone is right... It is garbage. Can't enter a date that isn't the current month for flights and after I enter a flight it doesn't do anything. Was expecting some sort of next steps to enter my passport and/or vaccination photos.,1
Lara Lara,"I am trying to finish with the form to fill out and does not allow me to finish. I hope I won't have any problems when or during my arrival. No way to continue. I am at the airport and other people are having problems as well. I hope you can fix it. We, people like me that are giving you a comment about what we see with your app, we expect that you do your own homework and try your own app so you can go through the experience, instead of asking to get in touch with you. Am I working for you know",1
Todd McQuaid,Trying to set up the app but must enter the verification code that is emailed to me. I enter the code they email to me but it reports verification failed every time. I have tried several times. Unfortunate that this is happening as many people will be discouraged - it seems very sloppy on the government of Canada's part!.,2

Cindi Williams,"When I NEEDED this app last night landing in Canada, it would NOT accept my password or let me reset. Very very stressful and useless.",1
M Mathews,"Outdated and buggy! The Canadian government spends all this money on a poor app that is not updated at all. 12-day quarantine isn't required for certain individuals, but their app doesn't list that and constantly sends emails and app notifications - annoyingly. Plus, the app constantly logs you out and creates login errors when using the right information (you have to keep clicking it and ignore the ""wrong info"" message to get through). Come on Canada, use that high tax $ and fix this app...",2

E V,"This app is garbage. If one of family member was excepted from quarantine and 8th day test why its continue asking that member about 8th day test and symptoms?

Natty Gann,"This app is complete garbage, written by incompetent government people. Every single day it makes me sign in, and every single day it says ""sign in failed"" 5 times before it finally lets me in (using the same CORRECT password all 5 times). Then when it lets me in (sometimes while still displaying the ""sign in failed"" message!) it has no idea if I need do a daily check in or start a new travel record. Eventually if I log in enough times it gets it right. My taxes are paying for this garbage.",1
Stephen O'Brien,clear and easy,5
Dareen Shahwan,I cant create an account,1
Kenny Truong,"Despite being considered an exempt traveler, app continues to send daily emails about quarantine check-ins as well as even asking for a day 8 test. According to other reviews, we just have to just ignore these notifications which is worrisome. What a poorly implemented app. Border officer also didn't even bother asking for my info regarding this app when I flew. Why even have this as apart of the process if no officials was to look at it?",1
Osama Zakout,superb,5
James Hedden,"Quick, painless. I like the camera overlay makes it easy to scan passports",5
DDSJ78,"The app is easy to be used, but it doesn't indicate what vaccine is approved by Canada. I entered my family info ( kids got two shots of Pfizer while parents got two shots of Sinoppharm, recognized by WHO). The app failed to indicate if quarantine hotel needed or not. It gives vague information. I had to Google it to know this information. I have booked the hotel, just in case, avoiding possible fine upon arrival.

Jacklyn Hammock,It didn't give options for people just trying to pass through Canada to return to the lower united states and if the final destination isn't Canada it is difficult to get past the last question. there should be an option for US Military.,3
Thomas Ritz,Too many questions asked for fully vaccinated people. Not very user friendly interface.,2
Kais Al- Hamad,It's really good program to verify about our daily report.,5

melissa Byk,You go through all the questions get ticket number. They approve your entry to Canada with this app. then they don't even ask you your ticket number.. I am citizen with 2 vaccinations. Web site didn't require PCR test. Customs did. They charge $5K fine. So bottom line app is great but it is worthless. Get your vaccinations pcr test before driving or flying. Americans you have no chance to get in. Big hatred towards to Americans. They think all of them carry diseases and have guns.,1
G Mundy,horrible.. horrible horrible,1
Natália Camargo,it is not downloading on my phone! and I need it to enter canada edit: nevermind! I updated my phone and it downloaded :),5
George Woods,Arrived on 07/07. Information in the app gave Sarnia ontario customs everything they needed to get us cleared with our negative Covid results. App would be a 5 star if it was updated for those of us who are double vaccinated and do not need to quarantine. No need to follow up with me when the red cross test came back negative in switch. Maybe your app could talk to their app.,4
Tim Leshchyshyn,"I got an error code that didn't explain the problem correctly,it said internet connection but it was a page Midway through didn't have enough information although it let me pass. I had to wait on hold for an hour to get someone to walk me through & point out the thing missing that the app did not say or prevent advance like every page does. For helping others, my full vaccination of two shots were on one page printed by my pharmacy, and you need to upload the image twice but didn't that.",1
Frances Donato,very easy to navigate through the process.,5
Scott McMaster,"will you please update this bloody app for fully vaccinated travelers! I've already gotten my negative arrival test back. I should not be getting emails and notifications! there should be a section for me to upload the results from switch heath (who also aren't set up for the new rules, after 10 days) and are asking me for day 3 test etc. update and fix your system and provide users with proof they are NOT in quarantine.",1
jhon figueroa,Really helpfull and easy to use,5
Mohan Singh,Very easy & helpful.,5
YÜKSEL KURTOĞLU,"I am a truck driver and crossing the border daily. Each time, I have to scan THE SAME passport and enter THE SAME phone number. Why don't you save my data somewhere in the app or phone so that it fills the spaces by itself. You can add and option to update the saved data or passanger.. It is just a matter of adding a button to the app.",3
KULWINDER SINGH DHALIWAL,Good,5
Sukhdeep Singh,good,4
Praying mother's Moments with God,very good App quick and easy,5
Scott B,"On 4-Jul-21 we used the app to enter on 7-Jul with relaxed quarantine requirements. The app had no provision to include vaccine info; we provided this to CBSA and told we did not need to quarantine. A week later an officer showed up and told us we DID need to. Phone support was useless, it took an 1:20 on hold to reach agent, who gave a URL you'll see in other review responses. We are in limbo, given contradictory as well as inaccurate info from officials. No useful response from contact URL.",2
Bruce Cowan,"This app is garbage! I entered all that information, and every time I hit the submit button, I get ""submission failed"". I've also tried both wifi and mobile data. I was already all stressed out about traveling, plus getting my Covid test back in time, and this mess is putting me over the edge. I've hit that button at least 50 times over the last hour, and every time the result is the same. I get to 16% upload, and get submission failed, code PF 400. What does that mean? If you're going to use error codes, then document them on your website!",1
Pawan Bahuguna,New update doesn't work. After today's update not able to do daily self checkin. I had to login multiple times.,3
Dean Linden,There is no input from boarder agents. The app posters you about a quarantine that has not been requested or is required.,1
David Hisdal,Useless app. Cannot tell app when you leave Canada. No way to get help. Nothing but threats!!!,1
John Jr B T Myroon,App is telling me Air Canada is not a valid airline and won't let me proceed to the next page. What do I do?,1
VMKJ Tech solution,The great,5
Lucy-Ann Adam,"Update - Excellent - thank you for the quick and comprehensive response. Very much appreciated. Gov of Canada website says to upload proof of vaccination, but don't see that on the app. No set travel plans for the moment, but fully vaccinated and trying to get a step ahead by filling out basic info.",5
Levi Davis,totalitarian,1
Akiko Oyama,Efficient,5
G Manopen,The app does not allow me to input my Travel history for the last 14 days nor attach copies of 1st and 2nd Covid vaccine certificates. Does this mean I cannot board the plane back to Canada on Saturday because of a software glitch? Very annoying and potentially costly.,1
Isabelle Rampling,Does not function correctly. I'm immunized and have received a Negative test results from the PCR sample which was taken upon arrival into the country. The customs agent at the airport already approved my ArriveCAN quarantaine exemption and yet I am being required send in daily 'mandatory quarantine' reports...,1
Tony Sunderland,Will not download on my tablet. Pending spins only. Still won't download to the tablet.,1
Crystal Ketwaroo,smooth simple process of you have an the information required,5
Pratap Chudasama,Very easy to navigate.,5
Paul M.,"It looks promising at first. Everything worked smoothly until my third day of heath check in where I automatically got logged out and won't accept my credentials. I tried to reset the password and still didn't work until several times. When I finally got to login, it reset everything and had to start fe beginning where I have to enter my flight details etc and gave me another arriveCAN receipt to be showed at the airport. Now I can't do health check at all.",1
Jay Reimer,"works fine but a bit tedious. why isn't USA the first option for ""where are you coming from"" and ""where did you get tested"" and ""where did you get your shot"" sine MOST traffic is between these two countries? *sigh* government bureacracy ...",3
Abraham,Very easy step by step filling in process. Every step is explained well. Kudos to the designer of app.,5
Janet Waterhouse,Terrible. Every time I put in the code it tells me it is incorrect or the email is bad. But I get the code in my email!!! I have 8 sent to me now and it will not work. If I need this to travel how am I to do this if it doesn't work.,1
M,"Unstable, login crash, not recognized network, bad design, very Bad interface, awful UX/UI Disrespect to users",1
Jonas Lee,"Outside of the dumb requirements that do little to mitigate covid spread statistically, the app has not been acknowledging daily check-ins which puts me legally at risk with the law",1
Shannon Emery,can not add kids with birth certificates,3
Liviu P,"It doesn't save time at the border. There is no question at the airport kiosks regarding arriveCAN receipt. Moreover, presenting the receipt to the border officer won't do anything. Although fully vaccinated and with a test done within 72 hours if arrival, we received emails next day saying we presented COVID symptoms when entered Canada. It's a total waste of your time. However, the app worked OK when I entered required data, but won't display anything after the arrival date.",2
ChevyNo1,"After entering the port, date and time, I was informed that the port was incorrect. This then wiped out the Information I had already added which I had to input again. Why does this app not autosave?? Why should I have to tell it to save my progress? Programming 101 apparently was not part of developer training. As a programmer of 3 decades, I find myself disappointed frequently with standards, or lack thereof, today.",2
Mac Nouri,"relatively easy to use, some answer options are not inclusive.",3
Karan Pandhi,"Fully Vaccinated and yet asked for day 8 Test. I was told at the border I don't need to quarintine and neither take the day 8 test, what was the update for then? The app is seriously flawed and needs multiple updates. No way to contact a human. Been on their customer service for more than 2 hours no one answers. once someone answered and hung up. Really disappointing and it seems the government isn't functioning as there is no coordination.",1
J Bridge,Easy and straight forward. Great job.,5
Jadranka Cuculovic,Excellent,5
David Ledesma,"This app keeps saying login failed. When all my info is correct, email & password. I just login in the website which actually works. 🙄",1
Tanya Simpson,It's glitchy. I arrived 6 days ago and are quarantine exempt as I am fully vaxxed. Every day I am prompted to report symptoms. So I attempt to comply and I'm instantly booted out.,3
Ross Douboff,"Looks like it does not differentiate fully vaccinated people not requiring to be quarantined from not fully vaccinated travellers. Kinda stupid. The reply below just confirms it, as I was referring to comprehensive functional feature of the app, not who and how gets exempted. In my case, it should stop sending reminders to report right after the negative result was obtained, on the third day. My company is able to fix it, and provide the integration, to enhance functionality. Interested?",1
Wanna Beinuni,"App is good but system is flawed. Double vaccinated people who are told at the border they dont need to vaccinate (or do day 8 test) receive constant reminders from arriveCAN to isolate and about day 8 test (and to check-in daily). I waited on hold for two hours to be told that is is a ""known system glitch"" and to disregard all the reminders. I wonder why, if it is known, they don't fix it.....?",3
Kate Couch,"You will literally be logged in, then it will say Log in Failed, not record your submission and log you out - repeatedly. ""Help"" brings you to a dead link. There no way to note a traveling child's age to show they're exempt from testing, so you get pestered daily for something that doesn't exist. It doesn't note your last day of quarantine or quarantine duration - basic info would be nice. The app is so bad that frustrated people will wind up skipping it.",1
warren mucci,super buggy!!!!!!,1
Arshad Hussain,Easy to fill,5
Heleen Pannekoek,"The app keeps dropping me out. I had to uninstall and reinstall twice. Change my password twice. I keep getting messages for my daily quarantaine checkup, but I am exempt. I didn't see the use of it upon my arrival back in Canada. It's just a nuisance and doesn't help.",1
Sylvain Leblanc,Web site easier to use than app. Login always worked on web site but not on app.,1
Gjergjenrigentianarber Sinojmeri,I experienced difficulty when asked enter the 6 digit confirmation nr for the hotel when the hotels confirmation nr is 9 digit long It's very confusing the hotel itself didn't know what 6 digit number I was talking about.other then that everything went smooth.,5
Patricia Beagle,"once you have all your required information it's easy to follow the steps to input information required. have all documents ready before starting process. I.e. passports, flight information and vaccine info. it will make the process go more smoothly.",5
Rodrigo Orozco,straight forward,5
Michael Hoff,"super confusing and conflicting with current protocol. while I am available to avoid quarantine according to their new rules, the questionnaire on the app directly conflicts with this protocol",1
Mehmet Ugurlu,"1- I cannot see uploading section for vaccines. 2- And when I log in automatically that I saved password and email on my mobile device, it says wrong password or username but if I fill manually with the same password and email, it works",3
Janet McKiernan,"Not too excited. I recognize the need, but I came into Canada on July 6, with proof of full vaccinations and a negative covid test that cost 200 USD. Although media said that I do not have to isolate, I was told I have to through this site and at Pearson as I was handed a take home Covid kit. I was not told that I there is a new site or how to reach it, and I lost my part time job because I was not able to get back in a 2 week period. Very disappointing 😞",1
Karen Manitowich,App is terrible and help is worse. Trying to get a verification code. Got one and it indicated it wasn't valid. They told me to reset password. Tried that. It said there would me an email telling you how to do that. Never received. Tried contacting Health Canada. They sent me an do not reply email requesting info but no where to send the info. I have been trying for 2 hours to set this up. If we have to use this they better fix it up!! Not impressed!,1
Costin Ionascu,Super glitchy app. Did you guys hire interns to make it?,1
Sean Newham,App supports putting in your vaccination but doesn't support the different quarantine workflow.,1
Anshul Arora,"Bugs related to login - It keeps saying login failed, or incorrect username and password.",2
Isabella Stefanova,Heads up if you are having trouble making an account: do not use a + or = sign in your password or email!,3
Doug G,Straight forward and remembers my previous partial entires.,5
Lisa Sinnett-Armijo,"I had trouble with the APP and could not use it and asked for clarification from developers on this user-unfriendly detail. Here's that hack: request for Canadian Permanent Resident ID. It will not accept the ID number labelled ""ID number"" on the front of the card. Instead...use the unlabelled tiny sequence of numbers and letters on the back.",1

James Clarke,wish all other countries had similar integrated apps such as this one. needs to have upload of covid test results too though.,5

Minh Pham,I can't do the daily symptoms report anywhere. There's no link or anything...,2
blaine ray,"Upon entry to Canada I had not updated the app, but was determined exempt from quarantine. Due to negative test and full vacination during appropriate time period. I was instructed by border agent to update when I arrived home and then upload the appropriate documents. I did as I was I instructed, but after creating an arriveCan entry notice, you can not later upload documents. You have to do an entirely new entry. I continue to get notices about quarantine.",2
Khaled Almustafa,just perfect,5
Robert RW,"I hate it! I used it before, then when I tried to log in again it said I had the wrong email or password, which I did not. I went through the forgot password process creating a new one. It still did not recognize me. I had to give up, uninstall it and had to use another email address to create another account. Now I am needing to travel again and it is doing the same things. Now I cannot use either of my emails. Why can't you make something that works and how am I supposed to travel back home ?????",1

Z. Z.,I can't seem to find an option where I will have to upload my proof of vaccination and covid test result. Please help. My arrival date on Toronto in 14th July 2021,3
Syed Ali,Update: Keeps on asking for covid test for child under the age of 5 along with threat of fine. This is harasment! You already know the rules and age then why? There are 17 reasons for exemptions but the app contains only 4. Plus other covid vaccines can be allowed as they produce required levels of antibodies. The antibodies can be measured in labs. PHAC needs to revisit their science education and must understand that their decisions are not welcome and not helping Canadians at all.,1
Graeme Luey,"Gone 12 days now, and each time have had ""sign in failed"" happen 7-10 times before the app lets me log in and fill it out....

A.J. Choudhry,Bad app.,1
Terry Taerum,"Version control... where is it? Apologies, I tried to add this to my previous comment. My recollection is medical software requires Version control - you don't want to be using old software. In this case it ought to occur when you bring up the app or when you attempt to submit the data. The parts that work are great but, having done years of work in the area, transparent and obvious Version control is not a ""nice to have"" it is a requirement.",4
Mo's World,"App has so many issues.. was unable to create an account from my phone and from my laptop. After 10 tries, a messaged popped up saying an account was already exisiting with my email address so I tried signing in and now it keeps giving me error messages with ""failed login"" .. would be nice to fix considering this app is now a requirement for coming back into the country to upload our proof of vaccination 🥲",1

ShivInder Pawar,😊,5
Nom de Plume,"Pourrie. Et impossible de faire quelques changements que se soit même avec un update. Canadiens, sachez que même vaccinés aux as, on vous demandera un résultat récent de test négatif (poste Stanstead)...Et à Lacolle, on vous en fera passer un deuxième....C'est incroyable.",1

Melba Carlson,"I had attempted several times to log in and load my vaccination certificate and it won't allow me to create an account, responding as my email is not valid, not on the internet, or security does not meet criteria.

Still did not work. Please help!",1
Dan Mullet,Arrivecan kept stopping without letting me finish.,1
Lynn Klassen,"I am beyond frustrated! I always receive the same error message saying my login failed due to email and password not matching or my internet is not on.

Judith Kohn,no place to upload negative covid test; s outdated guidelines that traveler must quarantine despite being Canadian citizen who is fully vaccinated and has negative covid test,3
Anthony Pellegrini,"Can't login, change password, or create new accounts.

Kevin Powley,I was deemed exempt from any quarantine while in Canada briefly last week. How do I tell it to stop asking me for symptoms as I have already returned back to the USA? Since this is mandatory we need better instructions on this process. *Thank you for guiding me on how to enter my vaccination info.,2

Emma Turner,"I have uninstalled and reinstalled twice and it still will not allow me to enter the country where I got my negative covid test. I finally got it to work after multiple efforts.

Doreen Power,Arrival was fine but now getting calls saying everone who crosses has a mandatory quarantine and we will be fined. Respinding to arrive can app everyday but questions are only for quarantine. We were specifically told we didn't have to. Very confusing and stressful,2
Sameer Kamra,"Confusing... Also it doesn't let you choose different reasons for entry with multiple passangers. For example, I may be entering under essential services or returning home and the other person traveling with me would be entering for family reunification. Really have to fix this. Thanks.",1
Shanna-kay White,It is very easy to follow and understand the steps given.,4
Martin Watson,good clear form to complete,5
Ehsan Freije,"Very bad experience. The app should allow users to upload Vaccination documents after submission of the information. If the information entered on the app that was downloaded prior to 05 July for a planned travel after 5 july for fully vaccinated travellers, it did not allow for uploading the vaccination requirement and the government did not advice the users to update the app to be considered for the fully vaccinated travellers",1
Gianluca Passarella,"I arrived fully vaccinated yesterday from abroad, the app is treating my case as if I need quarantine ( asking me to declare day 2 of quarantine etc...) and cannot find help, I was cleared by immigration my vaccines recognized etc.....perhaps because I installed the app before July 5th , where can I talk to someone to solve this? I did everything right .Thank you",3

Kaitlin Barry,"The process of using the app itself is very straightforward. That being said, there are a lot of issues with operation. Often the app says login has failed when my email and password are correct and I am fully connected to internet.

Satinder Pal Singh,The website states that the app will be updated on 5th Jul and the vaccination certificate needs to be uploaded for vaccinated exempt travelers but there is no option to upload the certificate. Edit: I landed yesterday and at the border I was informed by the officer how to update the ArriveCan with the vaccination certificate. A user needs to select 'No' when asked when asked if you are exempted. Then there is the field to upload the vaccination & PCR certificate. Such a confused app process.,1

Sheehan Terrell McBride,"This app worked appropriately the first time we crossed. I updated the app and entered all vaccine info appropriately, we are fully vaccinated since early May. On the last page where you access your status H, V, I. Ours said V even though we did everything similar to people who had I (immunized). The border guard made us redo the whole thing and refused to look at our vaccination cards stating they would only allow us not to quarantine if the app says so. We force stopped and V became I (wow)",1
Kathy Carter Amundson,The idea of it is great however it would be really nice if you could enter your information ahead of time. I'm from Canada and will be traveling and there's no opportunity for me to enter in my vaccination information until I am coming back to Canada.

cindi griffin,great after you find the correct app,3
Noah Lerts,"Ridiculous. If you don't have your travel booked yet, don't bother with this app yet. You can't input any of your personal data like name, passport, or vax status until AFTER you enter your flight numbers/port of entry/entry date...and if your arrival is more than 72 hours away, you're instructed to wait.",1
Nexus Khan,"I installed this app on 3 July, and I traveled on 7 July. On day of travel I uploaded passport as app required, but application did not show me any option to upload my vaccine results. I'm fully vaccinated and I had emails from health Canada as proof of vaccination but officer at border said he wants to see the vaccine proof in app. He did not care about emails and there was no option in app to upload vaccine proof and as a result, I'm asked to quarantine for 14 days. I have no idea what to do?",1

There is no recourse in the app but to complete my daily check in... What do I do here?",3
Andrew Gibson,junk app,1
Richard Moller,"You can not save your vaccination history or travel document info so have to re-enter it for every entry, and carry all the documents with you anyway. You can't enter flight data more than 72 hrs in advance so you can't even prepare your form and the just answer the screening questions 72 hrs before your return. I don't see any utility in this app.",1
Mike Borbon,helpful,5
Andy Tesluk,"So I installed the app and it won't let me do anything unless I'm crossing the border soon. Why not allow me to enter everything I need before hand, like my COVID vaccine proof? The final thing should be the border crossing! Right now I have no idea how this app will work should I need to quickly cross the border! Useless to me now and taking up space!",1

N N,"HORRIBLE. I updated and use it before crossing border in niagara July 5th. It DID NOT give me an option to enter vaccine info! Guard was confused and I literally entrered it all again in front of him. Showed him there was no vaccine form. I showed him receipt and he said I was good. Then today get email I'm supposed to be in 14-day quarantine! This app is useless and with millions of taxpayer dollars spent on it, I expected better.",1
James Sullivan,Thought I would try this app. It seems that I have to use the login that I have for my CRA business. I would rather not have to use that login and potentially allow someone access to my personal and business accounts. Is there any way that I can use a unique login for this app?,1

I'm except from quarantine according to the border, but the app tells me I am in my 14 day quarantine. Overall could be a lot better.",2
Anna Madden,On day 13 of my quarantine the app decided it was my first day. So I signed out and in again. Still deciding it was my first day. Signed out and attempted a 3rd and decided my password was wrong. I gave up and went to the website. I am not restarting quarantine because of app glitches as I came over cause of family in the hospital otherwise I would have stayed where I was!,1
Elaine Flash,"Updated app on July 5th, after 9 pm PST. It worked refreshed and we crossed border. But today, July 6, it shows not updated. We are vaxxd and need not qtine per CBSA, clearly app is not reflecting your new policies. Hope to chat with staff when they call us. Thank you for your efforts in public health",4
Gordon Scott,Poor setup options. I have an upcoming trip in a week and would like to setup the app prior to leaving with my uploaded vaccination records etc. But I'll can't until I am 72hrs from arrival back in Canada. Let me get everything setup before I leave so that I know all is well.,2
John Aaron Baird,"Can't create an account says there is a login issue, I use a valid email, strong password, tried the online version same problem, same problem for weeks of trying, help desk was useless, emailed tech service desk got stock answer of reinstall, have reinstalled this dozens of times.

Joanne Della Ventura,ease of use,5

Carina Vassilieva,"Very inconvenient that there is no opportunity to create a profile, even in the newly upgraded version. It would be great to upload passport data, proof of vaccination, NEXUS and everything else once and in advance of any trips, to be used on all trips moving forward. Really strange as the vast majority of apps provide this option - create a traveler profile. Hopefully, this is in development and will be available soon.",2

Unfortunately there is no ability to enter this information unless you are travelling in the next three days! Why can't I enter my personal inform, vaccine records, passport info ahead of my trip?

derek hardy,"It sent me a verification number that it would not accept, then later sent me another that did",2
Lisa Bozek,"When is the new version coming out? July 5th at 11:59pm? Why wait till the last minute? Having a place to upload your vaccination and test results will make it a true passport. The app is simple and easy to use. A little too simple maybe. A missed opportunity to provide information about the individual under quarantine. For example, it would be great if the app showed what day quarantine you were on. Countdown to freedom kind of idea. It could be shown to any official checking in on you during quarantine too.",3
Cynthia Scheible,the site is confusing and not at all user friendly,1

Ankur Jain,"App is fairly straightforward to use and had minimal issues. Some dev notes. If you start the process initially where you enter your flight number and then click Save and Close, it is not saving your work. I had to re-enter my flight info again. Also, there are multiple pages where the Save and Close option jumps up to an entry field and you end up inadvertently saving and closing when you don't want to. An example is the field where you enter the country you received the second vaccine.",4
Nalin Jayasuriya,"I used this application a few minutes ago to submit my arrival details. It was updated today to also allow the vaccination document to be uploaded. It worked flawlessly!

I'm not saying it is the ArriveCAN app's fault I'm saying if you don't receive your code in your Gmail app check your other Email apps it may be there. As far as why this happens I have no idea I sent myself some test Emails and received them in both Email apps. I can't post this without a rating so I will give it a neural rating for now.,3

I input the verification code and get a response back to check the email address, password or that I'm connected to the internet. No matter how many times I try to put in new verification codes it's the same result. If the government is going to rely on this app for proof of vaccination to enable travel in the future maybe they should concentrate on making a usable app first.",1
FueledByJet_eh,"I use the app a couple of times per week and it works well. You can complete and submit your data in about a minute or two.

Hannah Buschhaus,"App was cumbersome, time consuming, and not designed for travelers with minor children or those arriving by land. It repeatedly deleted my entries which is incredibly frustrating when entering multiple travelers. It might be easier to create separate accounts? But since it didn't actually work for symptom reporting, we don't know. Despite receipts, it didn't work and we were stuck spending considerable time calling in and entering repetitive information.",1

I think the app can be used very well in the future for fast vaccination proof or Covid 19 test results. If the traveler can download the proof, the autorities can have the time to verify the information. Can be a good idea for the Nexus lanes to become even faster, especially at places with just cameras.",5

Olumayowa Adebiyi,so efficient!!!,5
Eric Moller,"The whole point if this app is to be a huge pain to discourage people from traveling, and it succeeds at this task. You might notice some cool features such as: - automatic sign-out / auth failure - inconsistent notifications so you might forget to check in - daily check in status may or may not persist so you can complete your check in multiple times and wonder if they received it or not. 10/10 for being a frustrating experience, I'll definitely think twice before traveling again.",5

Ben Brown,"For those having issues with submitting the health report, you need to submit the report EACH day AFTER your reported time of entry in Canada. For example, you arrived in Canada at 1:00 pm. Later, when you are trying to submit the every day check at 9 am, it wont work. Even though you probabily will receive a notification at 9 am telling to report, you cannot do it until 1:00 pm. It will kick you out or the submission will fail. You must wait and report after 1:00 pm. Hope it helps.",3
Sophia Chan,"It worked fine before I arrived. I put in all the info and on the first two days after arrival, it would prompt me to report.

Laura Keoghan,Useless. Won't log me in. Valid email add and just signed up keeps logging me out if I log in online. With the app it keeps saying log in failed check email and password but they are CORRECT. Sort it out,3
Hermes,"How can Canadian citizens be required to use any electronic application prior to entering their home country? Passport should suffice, not answering questions such as 'what was the purpose of your travel?', 'where will you be staying?' etc. ArriveCan smacks of police-state surveillance. Likewise, preparing a paper document or making a phone call (the 'alternatives') are suspect. Such procedures make CBSA employees job easier, but that's not the responsibility of Canadian travellers.",1
Canada Ste,"Doesn't work AT ALL. Keep saying that I need to check if my password, email were right and internet connection is working.

So canada health don't trust there own customs any more. Also this app is only asking for personal information but not where I was ore what I did. I got a email from my boss that if we do not send this in by every bordercrossing it will cost us 3000 fine. So I have to send in info to nb state and cannada. So 2e,2

We were told that you should use this app to report your daily symptoms and report on your arrival to the respective isolation zones but this functionality does not exist (anymore). Currently, if you landed and don't have a Canadian phone number, good luck with the Roaming costs. If you don't have roaming...good luck either way. *update-1* We did create our ArriveCan profiles and isolation plan before entering Canada and it allowed for a smooth entry via Pearson.

It took me 10 minutes to figure out which one to put in and I still don't know if it's right. Then it diverts to a bunch of useless information and gives you 0 clue as to what happens next.

Broto Bhattacharjee,Neither the app nor the website have a place to update daily symptoms. It's only good for initial ArriveCan receipt generation. As suggested by other users I'll try to use it again after 48 hours from the initial entry to Canada. However the instructions given at the airport were to update daily symptoms. Update 7th December 2020 : 1. I used ArriveCan app at the border. 2. There are no Notifications (Bell Icon) even after 48 hours. 3. I noticed that my quarantine address is not getting saved.,3

Carole Cushman,Easy to fill out and saves time.,5
kevin mullan,Update - we can now report through the app. A suggestion is that the app notice tell users that the ability to input monitoring information may not be available until up to 48 hours after arrival and that immediate notice of arrival at quarantine place is NOT required in the meantime. It is the people who are most vigilant about complying who are left scrambling for a reporting tool when they do not know that a waiting period is the usual situation as the app does not respond in real time after entry to the country. App works fine but better communication about this point would reduce negative feedback and individual stress. We downloaded the app and received confirmation and the receipt prior to flight. Showed it to the border services officer at YYZ and went straight home. Information sheet states we are to enter confirmation of arrival at quarantine site and daily health through the app or website. Spent 2 hours trying to determine how to do that - no notifications through bell icon on app to allow input and nothing other than receipt showing if I log into website. Very frustrating when trying to comply.,3
Muhammad asad Siddiqui,user friendly,4
Tim M,Buggy app. They don't seem to test it before shipping updates. Have only got the web version to work so far because the app would not accept dates. Asks for password every time. No point on using an app then. Had to reset my password even though I knew it was correct.,2

I was confused and thought I made a mistake in filling up the form and had to resubmitted again about 6 times, but same receipt summary (correct airport, wrong arrival date/date - which appears from the time you click the submit button).

Roberta Trindade,should be better made. questionnaire is not clear. I f I say no to the first question It should bring me to a different series of questions,2
Mich & Rech,Good,5
Rouge Caramel,This app is poor and non functional! There should be a check in button and symptoms check built in. The notification button is empty. The website has nothing but my confirmation. I had to call in & it's painful to do so everyday. Why do you create an app that is not effecient? Please redesign.,1

YYZ 001,"I would like to know how much the cretins who created this garbage got paid. It does not work,you cannot put the dates,nothing works and it is obvious it was created by our useless Government. Why is it so difficult to hire Canadian developers instead of outsourcing to India?I am disgusted.Why can't we give -20 stars to this epic garbage??",1
Lusi,"This app doesn't work and staff don't know how to work it either. There is no option to check in or complete the self assessment. I was told to click on the bell icon and a link will be emailed, or to reinstall app if all else fails. Tried all these suggestions several times, with no result. The website doesn't work either and is blank, with no options. If you want people to report to you as per your instructions, please at least provide an app that works and allows us to do so.",1
Susan Steeves,Submitting quarantine info non-existent or impossible to find,1
Ivan Demishkevich,OK,5
Rohit Gupta,"works flawlessly, smooth and to the point.",5
Pierre F Salomon Du Mont,Joining the app was OK but you're supposed to be able to do your daily check ins in the app and there is no option for it... had to do my arrival confirmation and first daily assessment by phone. This is tedious because the voice messages are slow and they name every law and peivacy rule. Hope we can do the follow ups in the app in the future,2
gagan deep,Can't download on android version 5.1lollipop.help me out on this. I have no other option,4
Muhammad Ali Amjad,very easy and user friendly process,5
D,Easy to use. Would be perfect if there was option to manually input passport information instead of the app automatically choosing to use the camera first.

Alyson Campbell,so grateful to live in a country that is taking extra steps to care for each other. this might feel invasive but it is a very strange time we live in. thank you for creating this app to help mitigate the spread of disease.,5
jessica whyte,It's not working. I filled everything out before I got on the plane. Now that I'm home my receipt is gone and if I fill it out again I get an error that tells me I'm not connected to the internet. So I can't confirm that I've arrived home at my place of isolation.,1
Keyur Shah,The app lacks notification to remind everyday for selft self assessment,3
Tommaso Cazzaniga,"After my submission I entered Canada, but I was not able to update my status (arrived - no simptoms) nor to retrieve my file. Is there any way to do it? Basically it's just as I didn't use it, they will rely on my paper application. Web login shows, thought, my entry data. Weird",3

Laurie McGarva,Got through it.,5

Shwan Amin,good,5
Milena Holmes,"Found it impossoble to verify the account. Every time I entered the code they sent to the email, it would say the code was incorrect. *solution for me** after multiple attempts, only this worked: DO NOT navigate away from the verification code screen when asked to enter in your code. Open the verification code email they sent you on another device (e.g. laptop) to read your code and enter the code directly on your mobile app, having kept the verification screen open the entire time. God speed.",1

I had first used the app in June and again in November. Hopefully when I travel again, I won't need to create a another account! Even worse is reading the response to these reviews. You should address the legitimate issues with the app rather than apologizing ""for us having difficulty using the app"". It's not us, it's you.",1
Linda Newton,"Easy to use app...however, sometimes still has hiccups and freezing.",4
Connie Marson,this is the most USER-UN-FRIENDLY site I've ever used!!!,1

Chris Herc,Very easy to use,5
Howard Huang,"Can't create an account because the verification code sent to my email doesn't work. Can't resend verification code to email because there's no button for that. Can't recreate account because it says email is being used even though it can't get verified. Can't reset password for ""used"" email because it doesn't send a verification code for that but asks for one. Can't use the app because I can't create an account. I'm starting to wonder if I can even return to Canada?",1

Darlene Rogan,"I've tried to use this app three times. Once it wouldn't accept my email. So I had to use another one. The second time the trip was canceled but the health authority called my husband (Canadian citizen whose never left the country) to ask him about HIS quarantine. Now, like another user, it won't email me to reset the password so I'm now using a 3rd email. Based on others reviews, I'm not sure this is going to save time but now it's required to use the app? Again, based on others reviews, I'm going to have to call you to try to sort it out? For? To reset passwords one and two? I don't think you'll be able to help me when I get to the border.",3
yemi akidele,"This app is ok but it is counting the days of my quarantine wrongly. I arrived on November 1st, therefore today November 4th should be be my Day 3 and not Day 2 as the ArriveCAN wrongly says. Kindly fix this, thank you",2
Dan Wiedenhöver,"simple, easy und fast",5
Bhavesh Bhatt,"I'm unable to log in to the ArriveCAN App using any of my existing email addresses.

Tuula Kahkonen,My spouse and I are returning to Canada on Monday evening. I have completed the information required and wonder when/how I will receive the RECEIPT that is required to board our flight. This issue is causing undue stress.,3
Ric Jones,"A useless app. This is not taking your info online .The app. gives you a number, and asks you to present that number. So I screen shot the page. Well the number means nothing because when you get to the Canada imm. officer ,he asks you to show them the ArriveCan app and it has signed you out so the officer has you fill out the paper anyhow.Typical gov. app.",1
Iman Majeed,everything was great thanks.,5
Sarah Kaleemuddin,It gave me a message that my phone is not secure and hence the app cannot open! So strange🤔 I have an autistic child travelling with me and needed to try to get my forms filled in advance to reduce wait time at the airport😞 I am hugely disappointed in this app which should be facilitating travellers especially with special need children but is not user friendly.,1
Candy Hsu,"Form was easy to fill out but the main issue is that APP does not work in airplane mode and requires internet connection and therefore, cannot save ongoing process. Everytime I open the app, I have to restart the application from the beginning. I have a Pixel 2 as my phone.",1
Devin Morgan,great app!!,5
Elly Winer,Easy to use,5
Geraldo Macedo Jr,"Am I supposed to get a receipt number after filling the form? I never got an email. All I see in the app is a Thank You message, but if I try again I get a message saying I have an incomplete form.",2
Ed Miazga,"It says my email address was already used. Not by me! However if so, it says I can reset password with a code that will be sent to the email address. I tried three times and received no reset code at my correct email address. The app is useless if it can't be accessed. Ed",1

bernice welacky,I cannot even open the app. It's just a blank black screen. I have a Xiomi 8. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app twice and nothing,1
Leanna Doig-Gray,This makes crossing the border so much easier since you have your self isolation plan in place and recorded with CBSA before you cross.,5
Michael Hahn,Is this app needed when only transiting through Canada without leaving the terminal or going through immigration?,3
Ingrid,UPDATE: works as it should My flight isn't even on the same day the code I'm supposed to present to border service?! How do I change it so I dont run into any issues 🤔 😩,5
Cheryl Jocson,Hi. This not working. Crashes,1
Nina Hong,"There's nowhere in the app to report daily symptoms. If there is, it's very hidden. Just uninstalled and reinstalled the app and same thing. Very irritated.",1
Marcela Leus,"I filled out the same form in the airplane and handed it to the officer. The app didn't accept my submission until it was too late. I'm confused, Now that I'm home, is the app of any use or can I just delete it?",2
John Bryant,Cannot even log in. It basically doesn't work.,1
Gina Mulderig,App wouldn't let me create an account. Couldn't get it to work at all.,1
Leonora,Unable to register/ create account.,2
thea barber,"Poorly designed. I wasn't able to use it at the boarder. Instead of telling you that it needs internet access, the app just wouldn't let me login. It shows messages like ""unable to login"" ""unable to reset password"" so I thought the app wasn't working. I filled in our info ahead of time but still didn't know how to get the code. I thought the symptom check i had to fill in within 48 hours of arrival was to he done at home but it turns out that's what I needed to get the code. Not very clear.",2
Kangcheng Xu,What your problem with rooted device?,1
Suthar Noor,Great,5
Gilbert Guzman,Cannot open after following all instructions says log on invalid id or password. Try to reset and never sends an email. Removed/ reinstalled several times with no help! Samsung s9plus android,1
Jan of E,Very easy to use. Obviously not as slick as other apps as it has been developed on a tight budget and a short time frame. Made going through immigration very easy. Thank you!,5
Glen Kowalchuk,"As a pilot, I now need to carry my pilot's license, Passport, Nexus, CanPass and now ARRIVCAN besides filing my flight plan with Transport Canada, which contains all of the above info including passenger info. Why can't one APP consolidate all my particulars for CBSA making things faster & easier?",1
Shawn Vike,"Honestly almost useless Does not work in airplane mode. Requires an internet connection. Everytime I open it it want me to agree to terms. Does not remember that I have done it 4 times already. This app is on my phone. Should at least remember my username. Heck an option to stay logged in would be great. Download it before you fly, fill it out on the ground and reopen on the ground to show the code.",1
Don MacQuarrie,"Confusing and buggy. I managed to fill out the arrival info and show the result screen to CBSA, but that's about it. I arrived home and I'm not sure if I'm still supposed to use this app. It says to check in within 48 hours by using the app, but I don't see how to do that. Other reviews are talking about reporting symptoms through the app, or about seeing the number of days since arrival, and I don't see any of that? The pop-up info box can't be dismissed. Edited to add: the response says to report symptoms by clicking on the bell icon. I tried that, it takes me to a page titled ""Notifications"" but is blank.",1
Marina V,Would be great if I could create a password for a log in. It requires a numeric character in the password but it is impossible to type it in,1
Neil Egsgard,Want to report lack of symptoms after arrival but can't.,2
sushmita gurram,Unable to create password and verifi cation code,1
Dawn Pustelnik,So it took 4 days after my arrival for notifications to show up and the notification dated today said it was day 2 even though it is day 4.,3
Mai Lan Nguyen,"I'm editing my review because it's clear developers are missing the point. I received 3 emails from ArriveCAN in the last week. I finished my quarantine 6 weeks ago. I complained not because the emails are annoying (they are) but because this app clearly isn't streamlined in a way that's going to help anyone. If you're trying to send out emails to recent arrivals, the emails need to be sent the day of return, not 6 weeks after.",1
James Duncan,This doesn't seem to be working. I'm trying to fill out what information I need to supply before my arrival and it keeps saying that my form is pending because it's incomplete. This is just super confusing and adding more stress to an already stressful travel preparation time. Really wish this thing worked or gave feedback that was actually helpful.I have no idea what to do next.,1
Yuriy Korenyak,"Doesn't work for me, can't select a day in previous mounth in callendar within 48h of arrival. Frastrating. Update: when arrived in airport I received a note to register in app within 48h, so I should be able to select a day in past 48h. In web app situation is even worse, I can't select anything but today.",2

E Ryia,Not clear the aim of the application. Bad experience,1
m m,"Upon my entry to Canada, i was given a brochure that says ""report your symptoms through the ArriveCAN app, online at (some cbsa site)"". I registered through the app, i verified that my registration is valid on the specified website. I cannot report any symptoms, neither via the app nor via the website, the only thing i get on both is some number that i am supposed to show to the border officer (after i already entered the county!). The app and the website are useless. Waste of taxpayer money.",1
John Ross,Cannot access app....,1
Robert Clarke,"The app won't open. Says my phone doesn't meet minimum security requirements, because it might be rooted or have non-standard operating system. I have an Android Note 8 phone with current OS. The New Support interface is very slow as well. Very difficult to type there. Keeps lagging/freezing. Terrible app. It states that the government of Canada launched this app. With so many issues, I strongly doubt that. I'm not able to give zero stars...",1
Hadrien Dunant,"Terrible app. The app didn't allow me to answer no to the fact that I wasn't showing symptoms for a week. It now does, but tells me that I may be showing symptoms of covid even though I answered no. Furthermore the app indicates that I'm on day 12 of my quarantine while I'm on day 14. And my arrival was inputed correctly.",1
vivek kushwaha,"There is no option for reuniting family of temporary resident, which is actually allowed by IRCC after having written authorization",1
Manju Gupta,Good,5
Tarek Alam,"The app is full of bugs: 1) The time of arrival shown on the window where the code is generated was off by 4 hours. 2) I wanted to retrieve the code while on flight in airplane mode & as soon as I opened the app, I got logged out with no access to the code. I wasn't able to log back in until I could reconnect to the internet. 3) The daily symptom check says I may have developed Covid signs and symptoms even when I reported I have no symptoms.",2
Avi A,"App is working well.Previous bugs were fixed which is great. I did notice an issue today were I selected NO for symptoms, but the message after that was for a positive response,saying I might have got symptoms ,which is incorrect. Might worth checking that scenario with the Developers.",4
Colleen Jones,I tried multiple times to log in and each time got an error message stating that the email and password was incorrect or to make sure there is an internet connection. This app is not working.,1
Alex,can I visit a dying parent at home as a Canadian citizen or will canada force me to quarantine somewhere else and they might die while I'm away ? i need to know before booking the flight. they can't consent as they cannot speak or move. can the other parent consent ?,1
M Monday,"Cannot find info easily, I'm coming from Europe, landing in Toronto but have a connecting flight to Montreal... Which flight number so I put?? Is there an faq specifically for the arrive can app that I cant find?",5
Roy,"A lot is not functional. Immigration won't accept screen shots so I thought I would be an easy task to bring up my code again. The app logged me out, everytime I tried to log in it automatically brought me to the new user sign up page. You need to input your password FIRST, then your username, or it'll reject your sign in attempts. Lots of things wrong with this app. Scrolling through pages doesn't work, menus get stuck open etc. My previous entry code/submission is non existent. Day 2 of Q",1
sharon Sandwell,"Useless if flying corporately/privately, only gives choices of Terminals for where you are coming in to Customs. CBSA officers keep asking us to download and use, but we can't, so sticking with the paper form. App also crashes, and now concerned that my personal information is out there with no way to clear it from an unreliable app.",1
Richard Sutherland,"The app allowed me to register my return to Canada a few days ahead. Within 48 hours i was able to go back and complete the registration and was given the code for both me and my spouse. 5stars for that. Day 6 quarantine there is a notification to follow up on any symptoms. Declared no symptoms. App replies thank you but very ambiguous message stating ""based on your answers you may have developed covid..."" further quarantine etc. That part is incorrect and not helpful. Otherwise TY Canada :)",3
Kyle McConnell,"Can't submit symptoms if any. Would be nice if it provided information on what date or time you can end your quarantine. *Edit* I called the number below to report symptoms, and was given another phone number if I wanted to speak to an agent if I had any questions. Which I do, so I called it. 5 hours on hold later and no end in sight. I have given up.",1
Tarun Mathew,Theres a mismatch in details everytime we attempt an entry. Theres a difference in the date and time not sure if this will affect my travel.,1
David Van Doorn,Didn't work in Korea,1
Orestes Robledo,The app is so stupid that it does not allow you to report your arrival three days after landing. That is the equivalent of the CRA not accepting a tax payment three days after the deadline.,1
Larry Budzinski,It won't let me enter a user password.. Can't get registered,1
SUBASH MAHAPATRA,I completed all the steps mentioned in app. After saving everything and clicking on done. I did not get any code. It only shows summary. Did I do something wrong?,3
Liz Miller,Husband filled everything out online. Doesnt have a phone compatible with the App and when he got to border they wouldnt accept his screen shot so he had to fill out a whole other piece of paper. Now not sure how/where/if to check in. Would have been nice if they would have taken his code Very confusing.,1

Katherine Colven,I am unable to select an arrival date beyond September.,2
Denis Rosset,"When I tried to use the app before landing: I have a quarantine plan and I answered accordingly. It displayed my name in red with a mention that I didn't have a plan. Now, when I'm completing the daily check ups, I don't have any symptoms and answer accordingly. It tells me that I have signs and symptoms of Covid and that I should contact a healthcare provider. This app is terrible and worse than useless, which is surprising as the Canadian government, in general, has pretty good IT.",1
Kee Wong,"I completed the form a day ahead, indicating the (planned) day and time of arrival at YYZ. The summary page (with the 6-digit token) was presented.It does not show the date and time of entry. Instead it shows the date and time of submission with a 'check' mark next to my name (I took a screenshot). I showed the token to CBSA on arrival and they gave me the thumbs up! I completed the hardcopy form as well, but the officer said it was not required. So far, so good....five stars for the app and the process! Two days later, I opened the app again, just to check if the app registered that my token was 'active'. This time around, it shows a couple of 'X' marks, one saying I do not have a place of isolation. I could not read the next message when the app crashed. Naturally, I could not take a screenshot. I logged in again. The token is no longer available, and I am unable to create a new entry as the app only allows you to create a TODAY()-1 entry. There is no number for me to call for assistance as well. Now, I am worried that I am breaking the law, while I self-isolate in the basement!",2
Baljinder Singh,"I am using this for the first time. I filled all the details correctly. I dont know whether the app is calculaing arrival time from india or canada. Also, I filled qurantine details, later it showed no qurantine plan. I get upset.😕",1
Ashok Vatrapu,"Hi, tThank you for this wonderful app. However, I noticed an issue(please confirm if it's really a bug or my misunderstanding) I have a flight to Canada on 21st September 2020 and my flight arrival is scheduled to 12:45pm on next day which is 21st so same info I have entered in the app. But in the summary info its showing arrival info as 21st September 2020 16:45:00z which is confusing me. Could you please explain this?. Thank you",4
Nick K,"Update: The newest version seems to have fixed the bug outlined in this review. ---- ---- ---- While I appreciate an App like this exists, it appears to be buggy, as it shows incorrect information upon submission. More specifically, it shows ""no accommodation or food delivery available"" which is false, as I clearly checked 'yes' for both of those questions. At this point I'd prefer to just fill out the paper form upon arrival to avoid any issues.",4
Carmen Yu,"I arrived 38 hours ago and am attempting to enter arrival information into the app. However, it does not allow an arrival date earlier than the current date. So, I cannot progress with reporting. What do you recommend?",1
Johanna C,"Worked fine for the border, but the Gov.ca website says you should use this app to self report through your quarantine period and i cannot find a way to do that. My only options are for the border crossing and to view information. I don't have reliable phone service where we are quarantining, so I wish I could actually use this app to check in rather than fighting with the phone.",2
Mylan To,"After reading most of the reviews on here, I was hesitant to download the app, nevertheless I did it anyway to saves time at port of entry. And amazingly, everything from downloading to the questions in the app was simple and easy. I received the verification code at the end and showed it to the immigration officer and everything went smooth and quick. The updates of the symptoms also have no problems or issues. Thankyou.",5

Reshma Mariam Mathew,"App blacks out at times. And also, I had put in the right information but after confirming my time of arrival is shown wrong and it also shows that I have no house to quarantine and no access to food and medicine. I have no clue how that happened. I had answered the questions with a yes when that was asked. They have sent me the code already and there is no way to change it. Am I in trouble?!",1
Fahad Humayun,"I arrived in Canada on 26th August. As per my arrival date, today (i.e. 9th September) is my 14th day of self isolation. But the ArriveCan notification mentions today's reporting as 'Day 12' which is incorrect. Request to please help in correcting the days in the notifications. Thank you.",4
soobia ahmed,"This app needs major improvement. Yes, it saves time from filling out another form. However, please note that at the airport, you need to save/show the code it generates after you have submitted your details. The customs officers need to see and log the code from this app. So make sure u take a screenshot of it. Other than that, we are requested to update our symptoms daily but the app doesn't allow to 'submit' the response. The 'next' button is always inactive so it's really useless.",1
Carol Grindlay,I planned my trip a month in advance but the app wouldn't allow me to enter the info until 2 weeks before my trip. Then the border officials at the border crossing I used had no interest in seeing this information. They instead wanted to see the paper that i had typed up with the same information. When I got to day 10 of quarantine the app started opening with a completely black screen so I could no longer record my symptom check in.,2
Safia Tasnim,"Me and my partner indicated that we have an appropriate accommodation for quarantine but after filling everything out they gave us our entry codes with a notice saying ""No accommodation for quarantine""... This is quite stressful...",1
Mariam Lami,"I'm glad this App is available but it doesn't fully work. We were able to submit our arrival information without issue and we were able to update it as it changed. But, we haven't been able to report symptoms as per email requests on either the app or the web app for the last 5 days now. Nothing shows up when bell is clicked. We can only redo the arrival information (which asks about symptoms but we can't select arrival earlier than 48hrs) and the quarantine location info on the web app.",2
Gord Spurrell,"App seems to work okay however the associated arrival process is flawed. I am a pilot and use Nexus. I use Nexus to avoid standing in line-ups (well, at least one, still have 2 more lines before exit! - got to love government bureaucracy), however if using the app, you are required to stand in the line (which normally I get to bypass using Nexus) to get a 3 digit code of the day to show the officer at the 2nd line-up. Very redundant as the app shows that it has registered your arrival and gives a code. Not worth it! I will just continue to fill out the form and hand it in at the 2nd line-up.",2
Wilbert Martin,The app says passwords must include a numeric digit but numeric digits are rejected by the app? I cannot create an account?,1
Paula Hanebach,The ArriveCAN app is very user friendly and convenient (saves having to fill out the paper form). However I had to fill out my information three times because it kept glitching and not keeping my information and/or code. This is stressful because you begin to worry that the app isn't going to work. Once the glitches are worked out the app overall would be good,3
Ashley Kizlyk,"Speeds up the process for sure but only when it works. Often doesn't open just shows a black screen and their top banner. Had to uninstall and reinstall. Now it won't let me go to the form to set my arrival, just directs me up the info pages that connect to external website pages. If y'all need some developer help, I know a good group of people. This is an important app and shouldn't be so glitchy. Ya just uninstalled and reinstalled again, form application doesn't show up. Boo. Fix it!",2
Princess Egwu,"Nice, but in the exempt travel, there is no option for students. Some students traveling to Canada are also exempt from travel restrictions like those who have lab courses and so on. Please fix it.",4
job stuff,I have filled all required info and received token. Now whenever I'm trying to enter quarantine daily report I don't have the option. The top right corner bell opens blank page. On the airplane I've filled the form that was collected at my entry point. The immigration officer advise about the app so I've installed on my phone but no reporting option available. WHY?,2
ian pickell,Did all. Needed to change arrival time and lost most info,3
AD Singh,The app is perfect. But I'm assuming that a returning permanent resident needs to select answer NO under are you exempt from travelling. Also I didn't get the option of e token number as seen on various videos on youtube... Hope it's correct what I have done,5
Aaron Rodericks,"This app is HORRIFICALLY bad. 1) no real instructions in the app on how to fill it out 2) buggy and no ability to edit. My partner filled it out and it said incorrectly that there was no place to quarantine/no food available 3) there is no check in process in the app, or perhaps it's just broken. Forcing you to do daily check-ins on the phone. For something that comes with significant monetary costs for failure to comply... You needed to do A LOT better.",1
H. Verschoor,"Although I checked in within 48 hours of arrival, I was not able to get the correct date in. No other option then to skip the app and make the phone call",2
Harjinder Singh,Excellent,5
Harald Aardal,Doesn't work. When putting in appropriate information about accommodation and travel the app flags it as not having any available accommodation and travel from airport. No one working at Pearson uses the app anyways so it feels like it's just for data collection. The app also flags that you are sick when answering 'no symptoms' in the symptoms check-in. You had one job guys!,1

Aditya Gupta,"I'm daily updates, I've been filling, No I don't have symptoms and I got an email saying, as someone who have symptoms, please be careful.. etc etc.. and that someone will call me. What stupid UI. Also- no need to use this app.. they give you a form in the flight which you have to fill. The dates are also wrong in this app.",1
P S,I arrived on 27th of Aug with my family in Canada. As per the arrival date today is my 6th day of self isolation. But the ArriveCan notification mentions today's reporting as 4th day which is incorrect. Also after filling up the daily symptom form and submitting the button the message appears that you may have symptoms of covid even if it is submitted as NO in answers. This message should be corrected. So I started reporting telephonically to avoid this discrepancy.,1
Gagandeep Singh Sran,Easy. Quick.,5
Brian Colquhoun,"The app has some problems. I used it to enter my details, and to confirm that I have suitable accommodation and that it is possible for me to have food/medicine delivered while I self-isolate. After submitting this information and reviewing it, my submission is highlighted in red and it claims I have neither accommodation nor the ability to have deliveries. I cannot present that to CBSA since it contains incorrect and misleading information and is not a reflection of the information I provided.",2

Response from developer: ""This is a bug"" FYI, no- one at the border knew about or asked to see the ArriveCan app, not sure if its a scam or just worthless.",1
dhruval prajapati,"hello, can you help me with my issue ?! I have already an account in arrive can. but I am totally unable to logging into the account with correct email and password. I tried few time to enter in it but I don't understand why i am not able to log in into it ..",2

There is no way to contact support at all either",1
Selim Younes,Doesn't deserve the low rating it has currently. Airport experience was faster and easier because of the app. Very simple to use. My only request is for them to tell us when we can uninstall it (or if we'll possibly need it days after landing),5
Reza Shayesteh,"I am going to enter Canada based on work permit owners exemption, but this option is not on the list to select.",2
Akhil Mathew,"App is very useful, but its not allowing to submit day wise follow up questionaire. On reaching the page where it asks for if we have the symptoms for the people enrolled, the next button is deactivated so doesnt allow to submit. For new immigrants who mostly would come up with international roaming are still facing issues when officers try to contact them, it would be a good option to put a call feature or notification over the internet to avoid such hassles in this app.",3
Michael Bebault,"Just filled out forms in app. Pretty easy. A suggestion is this: where I am doing my quarantine there is no phone available but internet yes. I can be reached using my cell number and internet only on WhatsApp. If there was a small box for "" additional information"" at the end of each section or at the end of questionnaire in general, that may help. I don't travel for another 10 days so can't comment to the crashes that others have experienced. Thanns",4

However the Govt of Canada page provides 13 different categories. The app does not allow for 'Family reunification', which is the reason I am exempt from COVID-19 restrictions. So downloading this was really a waste of time. The app should be aligned with the official Government of Canada restriction measures & exemptions.",2
Nemo Wang,Why rooted devices are not allowened to use?,1
Tricia Jackson,"The form is very straightforward and user friendly but unfortunately it will not let me complete it. I suspect this is because it is 11 days before I travel, but it is not clear. I am unsure if a hotel classes as 'group' accommodation as I will be quarantined within my room Also I am not an exempt traveller (because of my work ) but I can travel to Canada because a close relative has permanent residency, which I cannot record anywhere",4
D Hopkins,The app works for me but I cross every work day for employment purposes and I do not know what exemption category applies to me. I am not a medical worker. There is no explanation as to what the categories mean. A help or info button would be nice.,4
Michael The Arch Angel,I've had this app on my phone for a few weeks as required. I'm in the transport industry driving expedite freight. First couple times I had to reinstall after each use. Does not save traveller info for more than a few days. I travelled on Friday back into Canada was off for a few days left on Tuesday came back on Wednesday and I had to redo all my information again. Why set up an account if it doesn't save your direct information that's in your account. Very annoying and time-consuming .,1
Landon D. C. Elkind,"The application works well. However, the travel document section does not work for travellers with a child under one year old.

I did this and it did nothing for my processing at the border. 4. It cannot deal with complex names. 5. Needing an account to sign up is superfluous. 6. The app itself is superfluous. It did not help with my border crossing and I was told it was mandatory to complete it 2 days prior to my flight into Canada. It does nothing,2

pranav chandratre,App worked like a charm till I filled up the form. After that it keeps crashing. I'm landing on 30th July 2020. I hope the issue will be resolved by then.,2
Arno van Aalst,I cant use it on one of my phones. I'm using Android 10 on my old S7. Why does it check if my phone is rooted or if I'm using a official Android version. One my other phone I'm using Android 6. Can't install it either because you consider this to old. Why?,1
Connor S.,"App keeps crashing. Was able to initially fill out form and received confirmation code, but when I arrived in Canada the app kept crashing. If I hadn't have screenshotted the confirmation code I would have had to fill out the paper form.",1
kommagiri vks,Error,1
Chi Zhang,"We are stuck at the registration page, no verification code was ever received, every time we switched between apps, this app just went back to its initial page, so we had to start all over again. Why releasing an app that no fully tests are done?",1
M. Hassani,Très bonne idée . App très simple à utiliser,5
Samson Anthony,Is not downloading,1
H SB,Great,5
Jared Tamana,"Completely useless on any device with a bootloader unlocked. Way to punish device developers, guys.",1
Ian Brogden,Password reset function doesn't work. Never receive message. Where do we find out that the Ivy Lea Bridge port of entry is apparently called LANSDOWNE?,2
sevi m,"The app is fine, but as of 14/7/20 you still don't need it. You still have to fill in the paper quarantine form whether you've got this app or not. The only thing they could maybe change in the app is provide a checkbox like ""have no plan for quarantine"" for the case where don't have the ability to make an appropriate plan.",3
Sam Lin,"So can ANYONE tell me what this token number is?? Says on the app there are signs posted in the airport of what the token number is, and NO ONE know this, not even the custom officers. Money well spent...",1
Jay Riddy,I have tried to install the app and it tells me that the app will be installed on my phone soon. That was a few days ago. I tried it twice. How am I supposed to get this on my phone?,1
Chintan Dave,The app itself is OK. But the border officer has absolutely no clue what it was. They has signs posted here and there regarding arrive can app token code including one against the border officer cubicle but she was clueless about it. Why would govt waste tax payers' money on such thing which is ultimately useless. Rather use the money to top up people's cerb payments instead.,2
Kenneth Anderson,Having had all the usual problems described with this app I discover it is in experimental mode and can only be used in 2 places. This should have been clearly stated at the beginning. A waste of time especially in these stressful days. Ken Anderson,1
Alex Ander,What was the point of this? Why is it on the website? Why are signs of it posted in the Vancouver Airport? It's not used for anything. And what is that number they ask for in the last question? Wasted my data and privacy downloading this. It's absolutely unnecessary. There are other forms to fill out - that they don't hand out on the plane to help you pass the time. Instead you have to wait in a social distancing line to fill them out on site in the airport.,1
Michael Sliwinski,A complete waste of time. Border personnel unaware of the app and no token provided. A perfect example of government waste and miscommunication.,1
Catherine Martell,Seriously useless. Downloaded it on 1 July and it does not accept an entry into Canada later than 3 July !,1
Zeenat Zahir,I will come to canada on 28 August but the calendar is freeze on June. So couldn’t enter data,1
Zimmim Ahmed,"Hi. I have a question regarding options under ""Destination type"" Im an international student and have already completed 2 semesters there. I have a appartment rented to myself where i used to stay. I had gone to meet my parents during my semester break and got stuck there. Now do i select ""Returning home"" or ""hotel, motel, hostel or rental accommodation""",5
John Pottinger,The list of Ports of Entry does not include the main road entry point between Surrey BC and Blaine WA.,2
Cass Bar,I cant even start mine..... the port of entry isnt even on there....,1
Alexandru Balasa,"Useless, waste of time. Avoid. The border guard did not hear about it and he had no idea what the ""token"" is. I only had to give my proposed self isolation details to him and that took less time than to input the same thing in the app. Good example of government waste, better use for the money spent would have been easy to find right now.",1
Josche MacDonnell,Need token? Already arrived at final destination.. no idea whom to contact now,1
Tyson Moore,"Wasn't informed i would need some mythical token at all by the people at the douglas point of entry, I'm already on the island with no real feasible way to go back, how am i supposed to get the token without going all the way back to the border? This process is clearly not very well thought out if people aren't being given necessary information.",1
Barb Rotteveel,I can't get into this App as there is no other and my arrival airport from the state after a night coming from Mexico is not on the list.,1
Jeff Cavanagh,"I filled it all out except the ""token"" at the end. When I got to the border, the personnel knew nothing about it. There was no posting for a token either.",2
• Rachel’s cooking crafts and more! •,"Hi, I have a question, where can I get the token number? Is it posted on columns of entry hall,or is it on the screen of the declaration kiosk? So everyone uses same code? Or It's generated after the electrical declaration ?I can't understand how it works",4
Paula Cardoso,"Where can I download the paper form, the app is not working in my phone",1
Andy Wang,"Assisting my parent with this form coming back from Taiwan. Very confusing as it will not allow you to proceed if you do not enter departure date. There IS no departure date if she's coming home, who the hell thought of this form?",1
Wei Sing Lyn,filled in form at Vancouver Airport upon arrive but nobody informed me who to give it too. so now trying to register with app but can't select the date of arrival as can only select yesterday's date only. can you fix so I can register,1
Ania J,I am flying back to Toronto today and was told to download this App...not possible...gets stuck on Waiting for Downloading,1
Peter Kennedy,Coming through Montreal from Paris May 16. Info handed out in Paris. Nobody in Montreal seemed to know anything about it. Usual Gov't roll out glitches where right hand utterly unconcious of left hand. No token available at either Montreal or Toronto or finally Winnipeg to complete registration.,1
Sandra Boudreau,I wasn't aware that I needed to download and complete the form via this app until I arrived at the border. I was told to go fill it in after-the-fact but I was not told I needed a token number to complete the form. There are no options to proceed and no information about who to contact in the app. It would be good to have contact information for support listed more prominently in the app as getting closer to someone who can help has now taken me 6 separate phone calls. Now on hold...,3
Eric Robberts,"It is only possible to enter 3 dates, yesterday, today and tomorrow. It has been like that since I downloaded the app. These are the only dates available.",2
Ian Xue,"Need your help here. Sorry the one star is for your attention. I am arriving YVR via Sishuan Airlines. However, there is no Sichuan Airlines in the airline options. so I cannot finish it before entering Canada. Please help me out",4
Adam Mattinson,"We weren't able to use this app on android or iPhone. Spent hours on hold with CBSA and Public health, with both saying the other is responsible for the app. In the end, border services said the system was down and they would call us back, but they never did",1
A Google user,Very user friendly!,5
abdelbasset chaabane,Got to the step is asks for token number after answering all questions . Where can I get this token number where I am supposed to get this done before travelling ?,5
Nate V,wants only digits for postal code no alpha characters,1
Ev Mckay,What a useless app and waste if time. I thought I be a responsible citizen returning home and downloaded this app from a link on the government page. Westjet is only doing repatriation flights to Toronto yet the app won't select that airport. How frickin stupid can that be?,1
Adriaan de Hoog,What a useless time wasting app,1
Brian Croft,"It doesn't bring up any land border crossings except one...Douglas Passenger? Waste of time. The travel information says to use this or a ""form"" but no link to print the form. So what now...wait for an officer at the booth to hand it to you and then sit there filling it out? Please update the app.",1
A Google user,"Not working properly. I am coming in to Toronto airport but the app keeps defaulting to Vancouver airport. I installed and reinstalled a few times but same problem. I type in Toronto airport, Pearson, then click on next and nothing happens. I have an Android phone and it has more than enough room for the app.",1
A Google user,"Doesnt work. Wont let me select my port of entry, only lists douglas passenger",1
