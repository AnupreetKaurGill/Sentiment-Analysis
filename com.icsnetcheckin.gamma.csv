Helen McNair,Estimated wait times are usually double.,4
Lorise Cablik,I like that I can check throughout the day and arrange my schedule based on my wait time.,5
Muruga Nandan,Smart neat fast,5
Rabail Khan,There is no way to check how much time until your turn .,3
Anita Thomas,Fantastic. Makes the whole process of going for tests faster and easier with minimal waiting. The app itself has been flawless. Great system overall.,5
John Moehring,Useless app now. Majority of clinic no longer allow checking and wait times are never correct. Today attended one that indicated Wait time of 0 minutes ended up waiting 20 minutes. During wait time changed twice 5 min wait and 9 min wait.,1
Shannon Chambers,"What's the point? I do early check in in Stoney Creek, aand they still took 4 people ahead of me after I arrive.",1
Gilles Laframboise,Must have. Best helpful app.,5
Andy Silis,"The wait times displayed are unrealistic. Plus, once you get to the clinic, the wait time in line BEFORE checking in at the counter are LONGER than the stated wait times. Finally, you get some ""blood testing tourist"" who cuts the line because they made an appointment online, so they think they don‚Äôt have to wait in the line and cut in; and the staff ACCEPT it, completely ignoring that the individual cut the line",2
Rabi Qureshi,So far so good. Pretty straight forward to use,4
Gary Jin,love this app. very helpful,5
mari aken,I feel bad for people who don't use this site to check in because i am always next even when there's an hour wait. it's so easy and saves me time.,5
Nicholas Medwyk,great app. helps letting you know when you need to arrive. very time saving.,5
Robert Lazure,Great app and a real service to the community.,4
Chris Ede,Great,5
Wayne Shook,Great service fast,5
Jacques LaRose,I checked in online and waited 1h30 to be seen. When I got there it seems my place was never even registered as they were going to have me wait an extra two hours in order to be served. Why do you offer this Services if your clinics are not going to be respecting it?,1
A Google user,A great way to book a lab appointment and not have to wait not knowing whether you will get in or not and have to come back another day.,5
Vadim Koustov,sms and push notifications are not working. app is useless without it.,1
Adrian Peter Galicinski,SMS is a joke not Consistent and on board with time on location icon! a joke!,1
Google User,it keeps removing my check in before the time is up !!!,1
Jan,"this sucks, booked my appointment and then cancelled that I was not there, and I had booked",1
Guy Montpellier,"Whatever you do, don't close the app. You lose your timer and if you try to check back in you get a useless message to check in as a different name or to a different location.",2
Wizzen Witch,Great System üëç,5
Mifthioul Wahed,ther to slow,3
Andre Filion,"great idea on paper, but not working properly. waited 1 hour and the app kicked me out and wouldn't let me sign in again.",1
John Ruicci,very convenient.,5
A J,The online check-in is wonderful!,5
jon ramirez,Garbage application,1
Phil Irving,"Great for tracking how soon your appointment is, 8 times out of 10. Sometimes local conditions change in ways that throw out the estimated time.",4
Jim Borst,keep losing appointment,1
fazil baig,"times are not accurate, and check in are not given priority",1
Kathleen Ager,"when you check in, your wait time goes away if you leave the app, then you're unsure of your actual wait time",3
Lynn Holley,Unable to book appointment as can't get into booking screen.,1
Harry,"Very difficult to use, no clue, bad app",1
Mike C,"Right after checking in, the app shows the queue status properly, but after a few minutes, it just resets and there is no way to see the remaining wait time. There is no way to cancel either.",1
Alex Boyko,"Guys it's one thing for a wait times but you must ensure people understand that it's only a wait time app. I spent money to be able to get my results, but them find out its not true.. come on guys, please redo the app or update it .",1
Robert Evans,"69 minutes left, then when I next checked, booted out, and can't regain my countdown. This is worse than refreshing a web page. What's the point of an app and registering if it doesn't remember you?",1
Katie Smith,I put my name on wait list multiple days and the system took me off I waited all day and never received a prompt text telling me my appointment time,2
Doug Inglis,Great way to check out the time wait,5
Barb Harper,quick and simple,5
Mark Silver,"Some annoyances: why does the wait time go up AFTER I have registered? If walk-ins are pushing up the wait time, what's the point of reserving?! If I quit the app or it crashes my reservation does not reappear and (it seems) I need to reserve again at the back of the queue.",2
Katheryna Paradis-Blais,it should give you an estimated time as to when they will be ready for you not in min but in hours. there should also be a count down to indicate how much time is left before your appointment,3
Maxx rocks,good location,5
Mark Moren!ucy,"the check in app is great , no more waiting at the clinic . workers all friendly and nice .",5
clark hall,Good stuff! Hi nice nurse at Cookeville Dynacare clinic,5
Lavigne Collection,App is pretty much useless.. Registered online numerous times.. Have never received a txt update... regisration doesnt even show up. Poorly labelled locations. Waste of time.,1
Donna Book,Terrible,1
Karen C,"The app fails to show the ""Checked-In"" status a few minutes after checking in, sometimes. Therefore, there is no way to figure out my estimated wait time from the time I checked in. Additionally, since I cannot see whether I'm checked in at the location or not, I cannot cancel if I have to. When the app operates properly though, I find that it definitely serves its purpose - I do not have to physically wait in line for long. I'm in and out of the Dynacare location in 15-30 minutes max.",2
Val Chu,"This app should be offline. It's not working. Confirm by their staffs. So, don't waste your time",1
Bill Bogers,"I went through the whole process of downloading the app and registering. Got there and there was a long line in the sun. Wait time said 35 minutes. It was one hour and a half. The receptionist said, ""Oh, we aren't using that.""",1
Kayli H,app works great. it would be nice to actually choose times rather than a fluctuating wait time.,4
Consty Parthur,"I don't know if work is the same in all Dynacare locations, but the staff at 2555 St Joseph Blvd, Orleans On is unprofessional, cares more about chatting & joking... A lady left a needle ü™° in my arm just to respond to a joke; then came back just to call a colleague to come continue, because it was time to leave; the colleague came and has to change the arm... These guys should know that they're working on humans being & not objects... With these distractions no surprise if samples are mixed up",1
A Google user,great,5
BARB Croke,personally I've been dealing with Dina care for a very long time and I appreciate the courtesy the cleanliness the support and just all around very good experience I've had almost every time I've been there in any of the clinics thank you so much. your dynacare plus is also fantastic.,5
Thee Pathmanathan,Keep increasing waiting times instead of reduce.,1
Usman Syed,Good but there is 73 minutes waiting time,5
Mustapha Yaghi,It's useless and inefficient. I checked in at 9 AM and was told the estimated time was 45 minutes; I checked 20 minutes later to find out the new estimated time was 53 minutes ... and kept going up until I was called in over 90 minutes later. I know that I would never use it again.,1
Ahsan Butt,It is a ridiculous app. It was better if dynacare shouldn't have it. Wastage of time. I shouldn't have given even a star if there was an option of Zero,1
Mike Rempel,This app is ridiculous. The entire app is basically a map of the locations and when you click on one of the locations to book an appointment it brings you to the DynaCare website. Not in the app it actually opens up your default web browser and opens the website for you to book your appointment. You could do this on the website you don't need the app. Also the app failed me. I booked an appointment for Saturday I got a confirmation email but when I arrived for my appointment the place was closed,1
Carole Richer,Great option. Let's me plan my arrival time,5
Jody,very easy to use and helpful,5
Thunder Soul,"Doesn't make a difference. Whether you book online through this app or you don't and just show up, you still get the same spot in line.",1
ir user,the app itself is fine but now that winnipeg dynacare all say walk in only not much point to the app. website let's you book 4 weeks in advance,1
Dr 235,Useless,1
Leena Fortin,Should have a line for people who can't stand in line waiting for your turn ie. Handicapped,5
Hitesh Parekh,Good app to net check,5
Coleenc243 Christie,Awful!!! Why have a booking app that doesn't work properly. I had booked with a 10 minute wait that eventually took me over 90 minutes to get in to get my blood test.,1
Lillian Saunders,Can't book,1
Bruce Gemus,I don't know the point to this ap. It gives me a map and phone number but won't let me book anything.,1
David King,"Worthless. Does not work with multiple locations on Toronto East End. Only few locations. Their staffs don't bother to pick up the phone either. A simple online appointment system, would've solved all these problems.",1
Kimberly Rekrut,"Don't bother with this app. When it came to the morning of all the labs said walk in only, and then I found out later you can make appointments on their website.",1
Byron Bwoy,"Taking up space on my phone... why can't it be added to the actual dynacare app? Also, what's the point of checking in on let's say a morning if you can't sign in anyway because of the buffer period?",1
Andrew Leong,"8:00 am : Lab opens. You can't book an appointment till 60 minutes after lab opens, so I wait. 9:00 am : Checked in with this app. Get first text back : estimated time is 36 minutes. 9:30 am : Lineup of 15 people in the hallway. 9:55 am : Woman from lab comes out to say, ""You can't line up here or you will get a ticket from the city if they do an inspection. Wait in your car until you get THREE texts from the app."" Also, ""the estimated times on the app is NOT accurate"" 10:10 am : Get second text back : estimated time is 7 minutes. 11:45 am : Not seeing anything after 1:30, go upstairs to ask if my name is still even on the list. Got scolding for daring to come in and talk to them, and was told to wait in line so they can do a pre-screening Before I can come in to ask a question. Lineup was about 16 deep at this point. 12:00 pm : Decided that waiting for three hours for ""Fast Check-In"" was pointless. Went back to work. 1:15 pm : Third text came in. Not to say - your appointment is next. It was to say : Your appointment is canceled due to no show. Do yourself a favour - go to lifelabs instead. They actually have a working application with which you can book appointments. And not deal with staff who don't know how check-ins work.",1
Joshua Malinsky,"What exactly does this app do besides give you the impression that it's saving you time by eliminating wait times? It's COVID and even though the app says I'm ready to check-in, I've been standing indoors in a lineup for 25 minutes so I can tell them I've ""checked in"". This app should not be available in the App Store or frankly anywhere.",1
dipali shah,Nice,5
Peter Bauer,If you follow the instructions properly this app works perfectly. Once you arrive you do not stand in line but go to the front door to check in. Then you return to your vehicle and await a text message that tells you when to come in. Again you do not wait in the line. You go inside and you are dealt with automatically. Those people who cannot read obviously do not know how to use the sign in process.,5
Mellissa Horner,"Horrible, this app is completely useless. People waiting in line get into the cue long after you're entered by the app, but they get served first. Also, your timings bounce all over. The first time we checked in at 1130 and it said we had a 166min wait. By 1pm it had a 191 min wait, which means it ADDED 2 hours to our wait time. Second time we checked in as it opened and it immediately gave us a 84 min wait time.",1
Robin Paul,"Absolutely ridiculous. Don't waste your time, net check-in does nothing except trick you into thinking you wont have to wait in line with everyone else, so you show up unprepared for the cold.",1
Cezanne Viray,"No trouble using this app but.... I thought the point of this app was that you don't have to stand in line to check in? We checked in thru the app and when we got the text message to see the staff, we were told that we had to wait at the back of the line! What's the point of checking in online if you're told to wait IN LINE anyways when you get there?",1
Denis Okay,Able to book time and not have to get there and wait in vehicle because they are busy.,5
Christine,Terrible app. Removes your check in if you close the app.,1
Veronica Chamberlain,Pathetic,1
sophia,"really bad experience. first the estimate time after check in kept on changing, from 20 to 80, what if the person already on their way. After.arrived and talked to the staff i have been told that i will get a message when it is my turn, i never got the message and the next after waiting for an hour, i got the.message that my check in has been cancelled.",1
George Allen,Does not work on older phone,1
Dawn Breault,"My only complaint is it gives you the option for things to have done at any Location, but they do not do some things at certain locations. You should not be able to pick to have, say, an ecg if that location does not do them.",4
Meg Cuan,Terrible app unable to use not enough info if you need to make an appoint on the app. Please fix this app,1
Brian Slipec,Will not let you book an appointment,1
Laura D,Absolute life saver,5
tomasz wenski,"Good for finding locations, and wait times. Booking online easy, just name and number. You unfortunately do not get any text confirmation. Went to 2 clinics and both told me it's first come first serve basis regardless if you booked online. Waiting in the clinic I was called in earlier, so I assume the booking worked.",3
Yosvany jimenez mu√±oz,"Terrible app, terrible service provided at the lab in King city and Yonge today. Worst lab I have ever been to. The staff is very rude.",1
Vera Murphy,Can't even get past the map,1
Adrienne Pilon,At first frustrating then it got better,4
B. Webb,Cant book an appt when you have to have the test done at a specified time due to prescribed medication that needs to be taken. I guess I have to camp out at their office. Ridiculous.,1
Kate Van,"App can't actually check in, just gives you error codes",1
Rose,This has to be one of the most a useless app I have ever installed in any phone. Wow!,1
John Chaffey,"Poorly organized ability to handle people in COVID era. Almost total lack of communication, even on simple questions. App does not function outside hours of lab operation, but does not tell you this.",1
Antonia W,doesn't find my location,1
Syed Akber,A good app.,4
GOPALAKRISHNAN ARUMUGAM,Good,4
Padmakumar sankaranarayana pillai,Its so convenient to use,4

David Rochon,Can't schedule an appointment,1
kristen c,"It's ok, it didn't work to check me in a few hours in advance. I waited outside at the eagleson location for only 20 mins",3
A Google user,Great app,5
A Google user,Works great,5
A Google user,"Oh my god, what is this insanity??? Who designed this??? Booking only during business hours? Is this a joke??? Why do you need permanent access to my location btw?",1
A Google user,Apparently there's no clinics in Saskatchewan. Useless app.,1
A Google user,Inaccurate wait time information. Approx 30 minutes or more off.,1
A Google user,Great! Save my time.,5
A Google user,"Good information once i went through the registration process. I had to wait until the next day to successfully register. From there, the app showed me all the information i was expecting, and more.",4
A Google user,Adding the address to the chosen location would be great.,4
A Google user,Terrible,1
A Google user,Didn't use my check in and had to wait 25 min,1
A Google user,Waiting is way longer than it's show in app and staff is not friendly,1
A Google user,Dont know where to type code Not enough directions,1
A Google user,Poor Poor,1
A Google user,Can not get my location. Not senior friendly whatsoever.,1
A Google user,"No point of the net check in when you wait longer then it says. I checked in , said 5 minutes , showed up a few minutes later and still ended up waiting in waiting room for another 30 minutes",1
A Google user,This does not seem to work. I checked in when I left the house 15 minutes before arriving at the lab. My name was on the list but I was the last person on the the list. How could this app be saving my spot in the queue on a busy Sat morning and no one have checked in after me for 15 minutes. There was a steady flow of people after my arrival. I do not believe this app was able to save my spot.,1
A Google user,Great App. Just remember when it gets to about 10 mins make sure you are there because it takes awhile for them to register you and you will be bumped backed on waiting.,4
A Google user,so convince for client.,5
A Google user,"Useless. No check-in option, only gives hours of operation. Don't waste your time with this app.",1
A Google user,"It's so confusing, not able to pick location",2
A Google user,"Works as expected, won't check in unless the lab is open, thus should be made clear in the app when a location is selected.",5
A Google user,use life labs if you are in saskatoon,4
A Google user,"omg, so broken right now. yeah I'll wait in the province beside me (Manitoba) in the southern part. not working at all.",1
A Google user,love it.,5
A Google user,"the application didnt work!! unable to check in, screen not accessible!!",1
A Google user,This app doesn't seem to work. It only shows a map!,1
A Google user,better than waiting in line !!,4
A Google user,"doesn't show anything for saskatoon. tried doing a search by city, area, even put the address of a clinic i wanted to go to and it doesn't matter.",1
A Google user,bad design does not work,1
A Google user,useless! it was.only showing me Manitoba!,1
A Google user,"Amazing app, very easy to use. it's too bad that some people are having trouble. What you need to do is search your Country & City, as it captures all Dynacare's around the world. Once you've selected your City you can look for the one that is closest to your home and with the less wait time. I literally checked in 22mins. from home, did all that I needed to do and walked in 1min before, I saw my name up on the screen and they called me in before I could sit down. Love it! Credit Valley Dr.Miss",5
A Google user,"it was good,polite responders and easy to access",4
A Google user,"Garbage. I'm in Saskatchewan and no matter what I do, all it gives me is locations in Manitoba. Waste of phone space.",1
A Google user,I don' think this company does this anymore. Check for LifeLabs app,2
A Google user,"For all those that are trying to use it and find it doesnt have your location, it appears that LifeLabs has possibly replaced this app.",1
A Google user,The app thumbnail shows saskatoon yet the only locations it gives you times for are in Manitoba. Broken app,1
A Google user,Unless you're in Manitoba it's useless,1
A Google user,Rating this app is below zero,1
A Google user,"Used to work but now only shows me locations in Winnipeg, I live in Saskatchewan.",1
A Google user,Terrible app doesn't work at all. Tells me to check in somewhere in Manitoba while I'm in Saskatchewan...,1
A Google user,Fix your app! The location doesn't work,1
A Google user,"What happened Dynacare? It seems you don't care so much after all. Despite the numerous complaints on your rating about app not working based on location, there is a lack of care in resolution.",1
A Google user,Great idea,5
A Google user,"The app USED to work great but as everyone else has said, it now redirects me to a different province regardless of my location. Manitoba locations are useless to me in Saskatchewan.",1
A Google user,Does not work thanks for nothing,1
A Google user,"Doesn't work. Set location and it gives me Manitoba places, and even when I disable gps and manually type the city I want, it still gives me places in Manitoba.",1

works...it easy english word...it sucks.",1
A Google user,"This app doesn't work. It seems to be stuck on the macro location screen

giving Manitoba locations. I reinstalled but it's still not working. Now I

I have my location on....it still gives me labs 700 kms away instead of 20 kms away.   Just visited the lab. All labs in Saskatoon are not Dynacare anymore. The picture on this site still shows Saskatoon on it....developers should change that.",1
A Google user,The app used to work well ...Check in at home and save time. But this morning it only shows location in next Manitoba ...But I live in Saskatchewan !!!!! Is there a problem or bug ?,1

A Google user,No labs in my city are shown so the app is useless,1

Here are the steps: 1- enable location on your phone or search address on the  map presented...you'll see if the centre is open and wait time. You will also see the sign-in icon for that particular location below. 2 - tap on the sign-in icon and you'll be taken to the sign-in screen. As simple as that. There is NO standalone sign-in button.",5
A Google user,Much better than before when it was hope its not busy can check wait times and then decide where or when to go,4
A Google user,"I'm in Regina, it keeps giving me Saskatoon  ??  Don't know what I'm doing wrong. Frustrating.",2
A Google user,WTH is the check-in button?,1
A Google user,It's a good idea but when your arrive there was a cross infront my name. nothing on the board saying to inform staff that you arrived.   How hard is it to add this?,2

A Google user,Useless and not working.,1
A Google user,Works excellent.,5
A Google user,It won't install from Google play. It just downloaded and then... nothing,1
A Google user,It is very great the early check in works and it works properly so ignore the hate comments,5
A Google user,Works every time and I usually and out and about when I check in so conveniently I can get my blood work done and move on smoothly no time delays :),5
A Google user,"Worked great. Walked into a full waiting room , checked in and got my blood work done right away.",5
A Google user,This app sucks big time. 24 min wait BS.   I 10inutes past as had double surgery this week and I still had to wait almost 1/2 hour more.,1
A Google user,Terrible  not user friendly,1
A Google user,Very slow in down loading.,1

A Google user,fkd,1
A Google user,"Practically no waiting time!!! Put my name on the list at home, did some stuff before leaving and when I got there it was almost my turn. Of course you need to let them know that your name is on the list already so they can put your paperwork in the correct order. Excellent!!!!",5
A Google user,"One star it's too much, people don't waste your time and our time doing this POS , before lunch something do good testing",1
A Google user,Stupid App.  Could not check in at my preferred location.  The only check in was for midtown.  I clicked on all the locations and still kept getting midtown.,1
A Google user,This app works fine and you simply need to check in before you leave home.,4
A Google user,"Worked awesome.  Make sure you note two things for success:  You can't book until they open, and make sure you check in when you get there.",5
A Google user,"App let's me check in get my kid ready and then we're off... if people would know how to use the app properly I'm pretty sure they ratings would change... this is pretty basic but doesn't do everything for you... let's you check in, gives to estimated time frame to be in the clinic by... have to double check in so they know your there... but this app is spot on.",5
A Google user,Love this app! I go for blood tests every 2 weeks because I am diabetic so it works out good for me. If people would use the app properly I'm sure the ratings would be better.,5
A Google user,"Works if you know when to use it, the clinic must be open for you to be able to check in. There was no indication of that anywhere tgat this condition apllies when you check in.",4
A Google user,Doesn't allow checkins until the location is open. Pointless and saves you no time.,1
A Google user,It does not load in Ontario. The concept is great if it actually worked. And don't even consider the dynacare plus they don't tell you until after the fact that it costs,1
A Google user,Cool works just as expected,4
A Google user,Downloaded the app as advertised on the screen in one of their laboratories in Toronto. No Toronto laboratories were displayed on a map. Asked receptionist and another staff member - they had no clue how it works. Uninstalled.,1
A Google user,Not ready for prime time! Only map works. Can't check in. Registration form doesn't appear after tapping on a lab address.,1
A Google user,Downloaded and installed it- opened for the first time and just have a map and nothing more - touching the check in does nothing. Wish there is negative rating available unfortunately I had to give 1 star.,1
A Google user,"Everytime I try to use this app, I get a message saying ""already checked in"" even though I haven't.  I've uninstalled, reinstalled doesn't help. Nowhere can I find any info on how to cancel the sign in (that I haven't even signed into in the first place ) fix this bug!!",1
A Google user,A great tool for patients!,5
A Google user,"Useless! Save for the phone number and address, which I already knew.",1
A Google user,"Your name is on a list displayed for all to see in the waiting room.  One would assume you are good to go. That is, until everyone after you is getting in first.  Solve the issue with a simple:  You must check in upon arrival to confirm after using the app.  If it is there.. It is not clear enougg",2
A Google user,I would like to give it 0 starts for not even opening after I downloaded it. Congrats to the idiot that programmed the app...first app that's ever done that to me,1
A Google user,"Second time in about 4 months I wasted  my  afternoon  and  night, away  trying  to  book  in ,  it  just keeps  telling  me  how  I save time !! Really?  More  time wasted tomorrow  when I have to  wait  for couple of hours ,  starving",1
A Google user,Good app when it works,1
A Google user,"As soon as I've checked in the app crashes, making me think i havnt actually completed checking in. Please fix the crash issue?",3
A Google user,Have to keep reinstalling it keeps telling me that it was unsuccessful sign in but when I get to there office im on the board *strange *,3
A Google user,"It worked once for me perfectly and kept me updated on my wait time. Now when I check in it boots me off so I am not certain of my wait time and I have to call them about it. Very frustrating, but at least I can still check in.",3
A Google user,this app will not let me check in.,1
A Google user,Is this application useful in Regina ?,5
A Google user,This is great. Book the appt and then leave from home. The dirty looks from those in the waiting room when I walked in and went straight into the room were priceless.,5
A Google user,Are there more locations in Saskatchewan to be added? I think Regina would have been awesome!,1
A Google user,That's an awesome idea! I hate waiting. Knowing the estimated wait time: that alone takes away so much frustration!,5
A Google user,Thank vest application ever,5
A Google user,"I'm always needing tests done.  But I live out of town with two babies and making the time and scheduling to drive allll the way in just to wait for an hour for one tiny test is ridiculous!!! Now I can check in,  drive to the city and boom! I walk right into a test room and be out in no time.  Greatest thing ever!!!!!!",5
