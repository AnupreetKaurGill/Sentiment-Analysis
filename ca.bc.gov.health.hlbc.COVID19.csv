Personal Coach,"This tracking app was covertly installed on my android device during a Test of The Emergency Broadcast System. It was easy to find and uninstall. Be cautious and search your device if they do another ""Test"". The real test is if you are savvy enough to find it and delete it. Peace from BC",1
Alok Dutt,Edit : android 12 was released in Oct 21 which broke the app according to developers major bug app won't even open and they fix it after 4 months. What I should say they worked very quickly?,2
Ellen Tsang,"EDIT: It's fixed! No longer crashes. Thanks developers for taking the time to respond and let me know I can reinstall. The Self-Check tab (on the far right) seems to have an error though. I just installed it without inputting any symptoms and it already says ""Please get a COVID-19 test and self-isolate.""",4

crazytomato 108,What's going to happen once covids over,5

Tobi Chun,"All links are only available in google. For those that refuse to use google, the app is useless.",1
Teddy,Just another propaganda tool.,1
David McCallum,I am spending the winter in BC. My phone is from AB. I Can't use the Canadian App because BC has one. I can't use the BC one because I have an AB phone number. I can't use the AB app in BC or the BC app in AB and AB requires a phone with Android 8 or above. My phone is a 2016 one and has Android 5 on it yet that is considered too old by the software designers - why? I dread having to get a Covid vaccine digital passport if they don't do an end user needs analysis first. They should not allow taxpayer money to be spent on a government app that can't meet the needs of at least the majority of potential users.,1
Marty Richards,Worked for 3 days not working now despite trying to update and reinstall Have to try something else,1
Herman Koot,Frustrated,1
D Nolan,Lies,1
Paul and Colleen Siemens,"Too bad the data is wrong. The app shows 407 new cases today but if you add up the cases in each region, they total to 507 new cases. You'd think that number would be double-checked before publication.",3
Rob,Mandatory download,5
Katherine Patterson,So far this app is goid.,5
Shirley Palmer,Like it but the stats page with modeling and projections has not updated since dec 23. Everything else does in the app when you scroll around.,3
JENNIFER EVERAFTER,Scary to see results each day,4
Marshal Swan,"Useless. Absolute trash. The app recommends contact tracing, yet doesn't provide it lol üòÜ. The app gives no localized case data, you know, the data required to make intelligent risk assessments, lol üòÜ. This app does nothing, and is the only tool available to the middle and under class. It's fun trying to survive a pandemic with no tools and no information from our government. Just delete this useless waste of time.",1
Sophia Maria Josephine Johnson,Great!,5
Adlai Newson,Not good. Tells you to get checked and self isolate if you have a mild headache. For useful stats it just refers you to the website.,1
John C,"It may not be a perfect app, but it is a good start. At least now we have a means to stay up to date with current recommendations and restrictions. There are improvements to be made, and I am sure they will be made as we continue to support it.",4
Kal M,The stats page is not updating. It's still show stats from September 30.,2
Stephanie Mitchell,Why? This is nothing more than an interface to information. It's time for BC to get on board with the Canadian Covid-19 contact tracing app,1
Don Adams,When I first installed it it worked fine. Now it has terrible glitches and freezes at the end of the self-assessment section. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it and it still dosn't work. I uninstalled it again.,2
Gordon Haley,Does not show the right detailed information. Northern British Columbia is vast and a new case a thousand kilometres away is treated like it is on my back door. The maps could be better defined.,1
Cf Cf,"Your app stalls at ""what did you decide to do"". FIX IT!",1
John Taylor,"The app recommended I get tested. I already know where the nearest testing centre is so I thought that was it, just show up. Nothing in the testing instructions was said about making an appointment until I drilled down to search the location for hours of operation. There in tiny tiny letters it says 'Appointment Required'. The finder app uses Chrome. Clicking on the text field pops up the keyboard and then closes it. So you can't type in your location to search. Pixel 3XL, Android 10",3
Clarke Hazard,Excellent useful informative thank you,5
MAXX GUN,WRONG NATIONALITY TO FOLLOW WITH RESPECTING THE LAW OF CANADA. OPENING A RESOURCE FROM CANADA: AFRICAN PEOPLE OR KIND ARE N0T WELCOME TO LAW OF CANADA . AFRICAN WELCOME TO AFROICA ONLY. TANK CHILD LAW COUNTRY'. WROTE BY: MAXX GUN,1
Wind Mist,Very helpfull,5
Vanka Salim,Very helpful and informative!,5
Matthew Bundala,"Your app keeps opening Google Chrome for news updates. However, I don't use this browser. Can you update the app to support any browser? Android has Firefox, Samsung Internet, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Brave, and many more - you need to support more than just Chrome. Once this is fixed, the app will get 5 stars! Edit: you guys fixed it!! Thank you! 5stars to you!",5
V Barone,I think you need to add a prompt to set up the location. I'm happy to have this app. Tx,3
Green Fire,Stats are nice but the self assessment tells me to call 911 if I'm feeling confused.,3
Pradip Khatri,Perfect,5
A Google user,I note that no mention is made as to where and how to obtain masks. Pharmacies are out of stock. Where can masks be obtained?,4
A Google user,"Worse than useless. This self-assessment app went in circles without giving me ANY symptoms info. As 78yr old with a 5yr bowel condition waiting now for over a year in a congregate care home for a scheduled post-surgery 2nd colonoscopy behind a parachuting army of folks with possible CANCER and now Covide19, I find the several dead-end links you offer to old or sickly folks to self-assess, frankly, cruel. Their end sums up my entire site experience: ""PAGE NOT FOUND. PLEASE take it down.",1
A Google user,Informative!,5
A Google user,"This app helps with understanding what to do, what is going on, and what the government is doing.",5
A Google user,Very helpful and informative.,4
A Google user,Would be nice if date/time of public TV updates posted on home page.,5
A Google user,Nothing really new or informative that is not available elsewhere.,3
A Google user,Great,5
A Google user,"Very well made, intuitive, and provides exactly the information needed during this time. As a bonus, the app is very respectful of privacy settings, and has location turned off by default. Highly recommend using this app to keep up to date with the current situation in BC.",5
A Google user,"The updates are now fixed and the app works well, thank you for updating, this helps track a lot of issues in the Hospice home I would also like to see a better breakdown of the daily check up a quick check up and a thorough check up option would be very sufficient but very well done app specially for proper information",4
A Google user,Doesnt provide the best charts to track trend/progress....new cases and deaths daily,3
A Google user,"This important part of life right now, I like to hear of many changes that I come in to hearing for better or worse Thanks sandy davies",4
A Google user,Great resource until recent update...now inaccessible on our devices. At a time when you we should be enabling access to appropriate info the app is now limited to due to browser requirements.,1
A Google user,This app is very nicely done,5
A Google user,It's pretty easy and basic didn't keep it for long I just keep the news on tv,4
A Google user,"Thank you for this app. Please include a graph of active cases in BC, if possible. Thanks.",5
A Google user,"I'm a hypochondriac, or so my therapist tells me. This app is great for me, I just had some bad gas last night and thought it might be covid-19, i researched and saw that some people get diarrhea which really worried me cause i didnt buy a ton of toilet paper. So i sat in my study until 3 am worried I was going to suffer from extreme pooping I was just glade I had my study washroom sanitized in the morning. I found this app dug right into it, went thru the self assessment and I'm ok. Thanks.",5
A Google user,"Good info so far, but the app is not updated daily with current stats. Typical gov't I guess.",3
A Google user,Good information,5
A Google user,Terrible app. Never gets updated and gives out of date advise. Makes you wonder what else the BC Goverment is mismanaging during the COVID crisis.,1
A Google user,Can't use it anymore. Says browser needs to be updated (not true as far as I can tell),1
A Google user,Useless!,1
A Google user,Helpful,5
A Google user,Keep having to uninstall and reinstall,1
A Google user,Useless,1
A Google user,"Some very minimal resources and suggestions for managing symptoms. A flashy way to be told to call the nurses line, for basically any scenario. Just call 811 and save your time.",1
A Google user,Lotsa info in one spot. Very helpful. üò∑,5
A Google user,I like it so far. I think we should see a provincial breakdown map by region. Use the self-check and government data to populate the map.,3
A Google user,Excellent. 2 thumbs up to the developers,5
A Google user,Great self-assessment tool came in handy for my family this week.,5
A Google user,Excellent app. Amazing the BC Gov can whip up something so helpful like this in such short notice! Trying to share with friends. Please review so it becomes easier to find in the app store!,5
A Google user,A lot of very good information.,5
A Google user,"I really appreciate how clear and easy this app is to use. Great job making a functional interface (complete with graphics!) in such a short time frame. I especially appreciate the daily updates and clarification on the self assessment tool, as well as resources regarding physical distancing, etc... Great resource for me to share with friends, family, and especially my workplace!",5
A Google user,I'd love something that started with a daily update straight from the province. Maybe a color coded system like fire warnings that is clear and actionable. What IS social distancing? Which businesses are supposed to be open? Which are deemed essential? How often should someone be at a grocery store? Make this easy.,1
A Google user,The assessment needs a better breakdown of symptoms. For example there are ways to distinguish between whether you are just experiencing seasonal allergies or actual Covid 19. Adding a few more questions would improve the value of the assessment and people will be less skeptical of its accuracy.,3
A Google user,"Never any updates, no clarification of who should stay off work, and an online test that only says stay at home for 10 days if you're sick. As useless as the BC government's reaction to the whole mess. People should be fired.",2
A Google user,It would be appreciated if I could know where the cases are.i think that is what people want to know.,1
A Google user,Clear and easy to use,4
A Google user,"Haven't taken a good burn through all the materials, but I greatly appreciate the effort to coordinate all relevant, accurate info in one place, along with self-check. Even if the app has wiggle room for improvement, thank you for making it happen. üëçüèª",5
